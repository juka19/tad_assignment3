Currently, the FGM statute prohibits performing certain procedures&#8212;circumcising, excising, or infibulating the female genitalia of a minor&#8212;for nonmedical purposes. However, it does not define FGM. In 2018 a federal district court invalidated the FGM statute in United States vs. Nagarwala. The court found, among other things, that the statute exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution because it (1) lacks detailed, record-based findings regarding how FGM substantially affects interstate commerce; and (2) lacks jurisdictional elements (e.g., requirements that charged offenses have an explicit connection with, or effect on, interstate commerce). In 2019, the Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to appeal the decision. This bill creates a statutory definition of female genital mutilation and provides explicit findings regarding the effects of FGM on interstate commerce.  The bill broadens the scope of prohibited FGM-related conduct on a minor to include  attempting or conspiring to perform FGM; facilitating or consenting to FGM, as a parent, guardian, or caretaker; and transporting a minor for FGM.  It expressly requires prohibited FGM-related conduct to have a connection to interstate or foreign commerce.  The bill increases from 5 to 10 years the statutory maximum prison term for an FGM offense. It also prohibits a federal criminal defendant from asserting, as a defense, that FGM is required as a matter of religion, custom, tradition, ritual, or standard practice. DOJ, in consultation with various federal agencies, must report annually on FGM, including the estimated number of women and girls at risk of or subjected to FGM and actions taken by government agencies to combat the practice. Finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that the court erred in invalidating the existing statute. It expresses, among other sentiments, that Congress elects to amend the statute to clarify the commercial nature of FGM, but that Congress does not ratify the interpretation of the federal district court in Nagarwala.","Crime and Law Enforcement",2021-01-05,0.5,0.5

(Sec. 102) The VA must annually report (for a period of five years) on its Solid Start program, which is an outreach program for those in their first year of separation from the military. The report must exclude any personally identifiable information regarding a veteran. (Sec. 201) The VA must furnish or pay for emergent suicide care, including transportation costs, at a VA or non-VA facility for certain veterans. The bill requires the VA to ensure certain notification procedures occur in relation to veterans receiving emergent suicide care.  The VA must determine the eligibility of individuals receiving emergent suicide care for other VA programs and benefits. Additionally, the VA must make referrals, as appropriate, for care following the period of emergent suicide care.

A covered veteran is a veteran who is enrolled in the VA health care system and has not received health care furnished or paid for by the VA in the past two years. Under the bill, if a covered veteran elects to receive more than one of the comprehensive examinations at a VA health care facility, the VA shall seek to furnish all such examinations on the same day. A covered veteran may also receive an examination from another specified health care provider. The bill provides that the VA may pay for a rural covered veteran to travel to a health care facility to receive a comprehensive examination. The VA shall seek to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations to provide shuttle service to rural covered veterans for such examinations. (Sec. 205) The VA must provide its police officers with annual training on the prevention of suicide among the population it serves. Each police force of a VA facility must develop a plan to enter into partnerships with local community mental health organizations and experts, local community veterans organizations, local community criminal justice organizations and experts, and local police departments.

(Sec. 102) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must establish a program to award grants to states and Indian tribes. The grants must be used to assist livestock producers in carrying out proactive and nonlethal activities to reduce the risk of livestock loss due to depredation by federally protected species (e.g., endangered species) and related research activities. Grants may also be used to compensate livestock producers for such losses.  (Sec. 103) The USFWS may issue depredation permits to livestock producers authorizing takings (e.g., capturing or killing) of black vultures or common ravens otherwise prohibited by federal law to prevent such vultures or ravens from taking livestock during the calving season or lambing season. However, permits may be issued only to livestock producers in states and regions affected or that have been affected in the prior year by such vultures or ravens.  (Sec. 104) APHIS, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the USFWS must enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to study the predominant pathways and mechanisms of the transmission of chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and farmed populations of deer, elk, reindeer, and moose in the United States. APHIS, the USGS, and the USFWS must then jointly establish within the USFWS a Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force. The section outlines the task force's duties, including the duty to develop an interstate action plan to stop the spread of and mitigate the impacts of chronic wasting disease. (Sec. 105) This section revises requirements under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act concerning federal strategic plans to reduce invasive species populations in land or water managed by specified federal agencies. Specifically, the section directs agencies tasked with developing strategic plans for the implementation of their invasive species programs to consult with stakeholders and coordinate with other federal agencies. (Sec. 106) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 the North American Wetlands Conservation Act. (Sec. 107) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and revises the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, including requirements concerning the foundation's board.(Sec. 108) This section prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating the lead content of sport fishing equipment under the Toxic Substances Control Act. (Sec. 109) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 the Chesapeake Bay Program. (Sec. 110) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network and the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Grants Assistance Program. (Sec. 111) The USFWS must establish the Chesapeake Watershed Investments for Landscape Defense program to (1) identify, prioritize, and implement restoration and protection activities within the watershed; (2) adopt a Chesapeake Bay watershed-wide strategy that supports the implementation of a shared set of science-based restoration and protection activities; and (3) establish a grant program to provide funding and technical assistance for restoration and protection activities. TITLE II--NATIONAL FISH HABITAT CONSERVATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS  (Sec. 203) This section creates the National Fish Habitat Board to establish national goals and priorities for fish habitat conservation and makes recommendations regarding fish habitat conservation projects. (Sec. 204) The board may recommend to Congress the designation of Fish Habitat Partnerships based on the criteria outlined in this section. Any existing partnership must obtain congressional designation within five years in order to receive federal funds. (Sec. 205) Each designated partnership must submit to the board a list of priority fish habitat conservation projects recommended for annual funding.

(Sec. 2) The bill provides for the appointment of a trustee for a small business debtor filing under these new procedures. The trustee must assist in developing a reorganization plan, account for the property of the debtor, attend certain hearings and conferences, and ensure that the debtor complies with payments required under the plan.  As under current law, a debtor may operate their business as a debtor in possession during the reorganization. The bill sets forth the rights and powers of a debtor in possession, as well as the procedures for removing a debtor in possession. The bill provides reporting requirements for debtors and reduces the amount of disclosures required by debtors under current law. Under these new procedures, only a debtor is allowed to file a reorganization plan. Currently, creditors may also submit plans for court approval for small businesses filing under Chapter 11. The bill sets forth requirements regarding the filing and contents of a plan of reorganization. A debtor must submit all or a portion of future income to the trustee as needed to execute the plan.  The bill provides authority to the bankruptcy court to approve a reorganization plan for small businesses over the objections of the creditors. However, the plan may not discriminate unfairly, and must be fair and equitable towards each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. Currently, creditors must generally vote to approve such a plan. Under a fair and equitable plan as established by this bill, a debtor's projected disposable income for at least three years, but no longer than five, must go towards payments under the plan.  (Sec. 3) The bill also provides additional standards a trustee must meet in order to void a preferential transfer for all Chapter 11 filers. (Preferential transfers generally occur when a debtor transfers property before filing bankruptcy that is beneficial to one creditor to the detriment of others.) Specifically, a trustee may only void such a transfer based on reasonable due diligence and must take into account a party's known or reasonably knowable affirmative defenses.  The bill also revises venue criteria for proceedings connected with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. Currently, an action to recover a debt against a noninsider (i.e., those that are not relatives, general partners, and directors or officers of the debtor) of less than $13,650 must be brought in the district court where the defendant resides. The bill increases that amount to $25,000.  (Sec. 5) This bill takes effect 180 days after enactment. ","Finance and Financial Sector",2019-08-23,0.666666666666667,0.333333333333333

(Sec. 2023) The bill reauthorizes through FY2021 and revises the drinking water SRF.  TITLE III--ENERGY  (Sec. 3001) The bill amends the Federal Power Act to authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue a preliminary permit to a hydropower construction license applicant for up to four years, instead of three. FERC may extend a preliminary permit once for up to four years and may issue an additional four-year extension if it determines there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant the issuance of an additional extension.  FERC may also extend the time a licensee has to commence construction on a project for up to eight years. Under current law, FERC may extend the license for no more than two years. The licensee is not required to pay an annual charge for administrative expenses until construction commences or a preliminary permit extension expires.  (Sec. 3002) The bill revises the criteria for a facility to qualify as a conduit hydropower facility. Under current law, such a facility does not need to be licensed, but must have a capacity that does not exceed five megawatts. The bill raises the capacity limit to 40 megawatts. In addition, the bill revises the time frame from 45 days to 30 days for an entity to contest whether its hydroelectric facility meets the qualifying criteria. (Sec. 3003) FERC must establish an expedited licensing process for issuing and amending licenses for certain hydropower facilities to be constructed at nonpowered dams. In establishing the expedited process, FERC must convene an interagency task force with appropriate federal and state agencies and Indian tribes to coordinate the regulatory process associated with the authorizations required to construct and operate a qualifying facility. FERC must assess the safety of existing nonfederal dams and other nonfederal structures related to the qualifying facility before issuing a license. FERC must coordinate with the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture to jointly develop a list of existing nonpowered federal dams that have the greatest potential for nonfederal hydropower development. (Sec. 3004) FERC may establish an expedited licensing process for issuing and amending licenses for closed-loop pumped storage projects in which the upper and lower reservoirs do not impound or directly withdraw water from navigable waters, or that are not continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature.  In addition, FERC must: (1) assess the safety of existing dams and other structures related to the project before issuing a license for a closed-loop storage project, and (2) hold a workshop to explore potential opportunities for development of storage projects at abandoned mine sites.  (Sec. 3005) The bill outlines considerations that FERC must make when determining the relicensing terms for hydropower licensees.  (Sec. 3006) The bill sets forth procedures for the case of FERC not taking action after notice by a public utility of a rate change.  (Sec. 3007) The bill authorizes FERC, upon request, to extend by six years the time period during which construction must commence on the Red River Lock and Dam No. 3, 4, and 5 Hydroelectric Projects located on the Red River in Louisiana. The licensee is not required to pay an annual charge for administrative expenses until construction commences. FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired.  (Sec. 3008) FERC, upon request, must issue a stay of the statutory deadline by which construction must commence on the Mahoney Lake Hydroelectric Project located in Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska.  If certain conditions are met, FERC may extend for up to six years the statutory deadline by which construction must commence on the project.  (Sec. 3009) The Department of Energy must draw down and sell 5,000,000 barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2028.  TITLE IV--OTHER MATTERS  Subtitle A--Clean Water  (Sec. 4101) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must establish a stormwater infrastructure funding task force composed of representatives from governmental and private entities. The task force must study, and develop recommendations for improving, the availability of funding for stormwater infrastructure to meet the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act).  (Sec. 4102) The EPA must update and disseminate information on cost-effective and alternative wastewater recycling and treatment technologies.  (Sec. 4103) The bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to authorize the EPA to make grants to nonprofit organizations to provide technical assistance relating to wastewater treatment systems in rural, small, and tribal municipalities. (Sec. 4104) The bill reauthorizes the Management Conference of the Long Island Sound Study, the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act of 2006, the Long Island Sound Grants, and Long Island Sound Stewardship Grants through FY2023. The EPA's Office of the Management Conference of the Long Island Sound Study must include in studies on strengthening the implementation of the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for Long Island Sound environmental vulnerabilities of the sound watershed. The office must: (1) develop and implement strategies to increase education and awareness about the ecological health and water quality of the sound; and (2) monitor progress toward meeting the goals, actions, and schedules of the plan. The limit on the federal share for certain grants for projects and studies to help implement the plan is revised by increasing the limit for grants other than citizen involvement and education grants.  A federal agency that owns or occupies real property, or carries out activities, within the sound watershed must ensure that the property and activities are consistent with the plan to the maximum extent practicable.  (Sec. 4105) The bill reauthorizes the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program through FY2021.  (Sec. 4106) The bill reauthorizes through FY2020 and revises the sewer overflow control grant program, including by allowing the EPA to provide grants for measures to reuse stormwater.  (Sec. 4107) States may use their SRFs to provide assistance to households with income below a certain threshold for decentralized wastewater systems or cost-effective connections of the households to publicly owned treatment works. Subtitle B--WIFIA Reauthorization and Innovative Financing for State Loan Funds  (Sec. 4201) WRRDA 2014 is amended to reauthorize through FY2021 and revise the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, including by providing additional sources of funding for state infrastructure financing authorities. Subtitle C--Miscellaneous  (Sec. 4302) The Bureau of Reclamation must develop a flood prevention action plan for each state within the Snake River Basin.  (Sec. 4303) The GAO must audit and report on certain maintenance repayment contracts between the United States and the Bostwick Division for repairs to the Tainter gates and other features at the Harlan County Dam in Nebraska. (Sec. 4304) The EPA must establish a competitive grant program to: (1) assist the development of innovative activities relating to workforce development in the water utility sector, and (2) expand public awareness about water utilities and connect individuals to careers in the water utility sector.  (Sec. 4305) The EPA must assign at least one employee in each of its regional offices to serve as a liaison to minority, tribal, and low-income communities. (Sec. 4306) The bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide statutory authority for the WaterSense Program of the EPA, which allows water-efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services to bear a &quot;WaterSense&quot; label.    (Sec. 4307) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must use the most expeditious procedure practicable to process and administer certain permits that allow the taking of certain wild animals, such as bald eagles.  (Sec. 4308) The Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to authorize Interior to align water supplies and demand for irrigation water users associated with the Klamath Project, which is a Reclamation project in California and Oregon.

Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act This bill updates copyright law by creating a new compulsory licensing system for digital music services that transmit sound recordings. It also provides for federal protection to sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which are currently only covered by state law. It also authorizes royalties for producers, mixers, and sound engineers that made a creative contribution to a sound recording. TITLE I--Music Licensing Modernization Musical Works Modernization Act Compulsory licensing systems allow a person or company to use a copyright-protected work by agreeing to pay a set rate, without having to negotiate with or get explicit permission from the rights holder. This title updates requirements for compulsory licenses for sound recordings. It establishes a new compulsory licensing system that is explicitly available to digital music service providers, where it was unclear whether previously available compulsory licenses granted the rights needed by such services. Under this title, compulsory licenses are available for sound recordings that have previously been distributed to the public. If the recording has not been publicly distributed, a digital music service can get a license for the recording with the permission of the owner of the distribution right. The new compulsory license is called a blanket license, which covers essentially all publicly distributed sound recordings. It gives the licensee the right to make and distribute digital copies of the recordings, along with reasonable and necessary activities such as making server and incidental reproductions. The blanket license shall be available January 1, 2021.  When the blanket license becomes available, it shall replace any compulsory licenses that the digital music service provider had previously obtained.  If a digital music provider and rights holder has a voluntary agreement in place, in most instances that voluntary agreement shall remain in effect even after the blanket license becomes available.  The Copyright Office shall designate a nonprofit entity to administer the blanket license, which the bill refers to as the mechanical licensing collective. The collective's duties include:  offering and administering blanket licenses, and collecting and distributing royalties; maintaining a musical works database with information needed to run the system; handling requests to claim ownership of copyrights, and devising a method for distributing royalties for works with unknown owners; collecting administrative assessments from digital music providers and other licensees to support the collective's functions; enforcing rights and obligations under the license; and maintaining and providing necessary information for proceedings to set royalty rates and assessments.  Digital music service providers seeking a blanket license shall notify the mechanical licensing collective of its activities that fall under the license. The license shall go into effect within 30 days of the collective receiving the notice, unless the collective issues a written rejection explaining its reasons. The collective can only reject a notice of license if the provider has had a blanket license terminated in the past three years, or if the notice fails to meet statutory or legal requirements. If a digital music provider makes and distributes recordings without a license, it shall be barred from getting a blanket license for three years. The mechanical licensing collective shall establish a publicly-searchable database with information including the title of the recording, the copyright owners and ownership percentages of each, and the owners' contact information. The database shall also have entries for recordings where the ownership information is unknown or incomplete. Copyright owners shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide information about their recordings for the database. The mechanical licensing collective shall collect and distribute royalties based on usage reports provided by the digital service providers. For recordings with unknown copyright holders, the collective shall place the collected royalties in an interest-bearing account. After three years, the unknown owner royalties and accrued interest shall be distributed to the known copyright holders in the database, with each receiving a portion based on their relative market shares. The copyright holders shall pay no less than 50% of the unclaimed royalties to songwriters. The licensees shall make monthly royalty payments to the collective and submit reports about its usage of musical works covered by the blanket license.  A digital music service provider shall be in default if it misses a monthly royalty payment or report, fails to pay an administrative assessment, or breaches another material term of the blanket license. The mechanical licensing collective shall notify the provider in writing of the default, and that the license shall automatically terminate in 60 days unless the service provider fixes the defects.  The bill requires licensees with significant non-blanket activities to report their monthly usage data to the mechanical licensing collective and pay an administrative assessment to help support the collective's activities. These significant non-blanket licensees are typically large licensees that took voluntary licenses with rights holders rather than, or alongside, a blanket license. The Copyright Office shall also designate a nonprofit entity to coordinate the licensees' activities with the music collective. This digital licensee coordinator's duties include helping the mechanical licensing collective collect administrative assessments, and gathering and maintaining information for use in proceedings to set the blanket license royalty rates. The Copyright Royalty Board shall hold proceedings to set the administrative assessment rates, based on the mechanical licensing collective's costs. The board shall also hold proceedings to set the rates and terms for the blanket license that most clearly represent what would have been negotiated in the marketplace, and based on economic and competitive information presented by the parties. The mechanical licensing collective and digital licensee coordinator shall not participate directly in the rate setting proceeding, but may gather and provide economic and usage data for the parties. Compulsory licenses used for reproduction and distribution rights shall in most instances be automatically substituted for the blanket license when it becomes available. Compulsory licenses for making and distributing permanent downloads will not convert to the blanket license until the record company terminates the license. Voluntary licensing agreements shall remain in effect after the blanket license becomes available. This title also temporarily limits the liability of digital music service providers for unlicensed uses on or after January 1, 2018. For unlicensed uses that fall within the blanket license, copyright holders shall only recover the royalty they would have received. To take advantage of this limited liability, the service provider must make monthly attempts to identify the rights holders of the relevant recordings and pay royalties to them. For unidentified rights holders, the music provider must calculate and collect the royalties, to be paid to the mechanical licensing collective when the blanket license becomes available. TITLE II--Classics Protection and Access  Classics Protection and Access Act This title provides federal protection for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which are currently only covered by state law. Sound recordings first published before 1923 shall be protected through 2021. Recordings from 1923 to 1946 shall be protected through the end of the year that is 100 years from the date of first publication. Recordings from 1947 to 1956 shall be protected through the end of the year that is 110 years from first publication. Recordings fixed after 1956 and before February 15, 1972, shall be protected until February 15, 2067. Owners of copyrights for pre-1972 recordings shall receive royalties for digital audio transmissions and reproductions. These royalties shall be paid in accordance with already-established statutory licensing schemes for post-1972 sound recordings. This title also allows for the noncommercial use of orphan works, which are sound recordings with unidentified rights owners. The noncommercial use shall be allowed after the user makes a reasonable attempt to find the rights owner and fails to do so, and a public notice period to give the owner a chance to object to the use. To qualify for statutory damages or attorneys' fees in an infringement action involving pre-1972 recordings, the rights owner must file with the Copyright Office a notice with information about its claimed works.  This title also preempts most state law claims involving pre-1972 sound recordings.   TITLE III--ALLOCATION FOR MUSIC PRODUCERS Allocation for Music Producers Act or the AMP Act  This title provides statutory authority for and expands existing practices for distributing royalties to producers, mixers, and sound engineers who made a creative contribution to a sound recording. A nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Board shall adopt procedures for such royalty payments for various digital transmissions of the recording. The procedures shall allow the owner of the exclusive right to publicly perform the sound recording or the featured artist to instruct the collective to calculate and distribute the payments to the producers, mixers, and sound engineers. The instruction is called a &quot;letter of direction.&quot; For sound recordings fixed before November 1, 1995, the nonprofit collective shall adopt policies for collecting and distributing such royalties, even without a letter of direction. The collective and those seeking royalties shall attempt to contact the featured artist to get a letter of direction. However, if the artist does not object within a specified time frame, the collective may distribute the royalties. This title preempts state laws that may otherwise apply, such as those related to abandoned property or escheatment. ","Commerce",2018-10-11,0.28125,0.71875

Regarding multilateral debt relief and assistance, the bill:  urges the Department of the Treasury to direct each U.S. executive director of a multilateral development bank to support efforts to reevaluate plans to restructure, rebuild, reschedule, or eliminate Zimbabwe's sovereign debt held by that bank and provide an analysis based on reasonable financial options to achieve those goals; removes as a condition of presidential certification that conditions are met for providing multilateral assistance that the government is making a good faith effort to fulfill the terms of the agreement on ending the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and removes a requirement of consistency of the land reform program with agreements reached at the International Donors' Conference on Land Reform and Resettlement in Zimbabwe in September 1998.

Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. (Sec. 7) The bill amends the Act to:  revise and introduce definitions, including common definitions for terms already defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act; and divide career and technical education (CTE) students into CTE concentrators and CTE participants.  The term ""CTE concentrators"" means:   at the secondary school level, a student served by an eligible recipient specified in this bill, who has completed at least two courses in a single CTE program or program of study; or at the postsecondary level, such an enrolled student who has earned at least 12 credits within a CTE program or program of study, or completed such a program if it encompasses fewer than 12 credits or the equivalent in total.   The term ""CTE participant"" means an individual who completes at least one course in an eligible recipient's CTE program or program of study. (Sec. 9) The federal government may not condition grant funding on the adoption of specific curricula or content, including Common Core State Standards or mandate the use of specific curricula or content through such grants. The Department of Education (ED) must notify Congress and wait for its comments before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking related to the Act in the Federal Register. TITLE I--CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES Part A--Allotment and Allocation (Sec. 110) This bill makes the following revisions to requirements for reservations and state allotment and within-state funding allocations:   revises the state allotment formula used to determine a state's minimum allotment for fiscal years when there are additional unreserved appropriated amounts; for these fiscal years, ED shall allocate to a state the same amount received for FY2018;    states are allowed to reserve up to 15% (currently, 10%) of their within-state allocations for current uses; states may reserve 2% (currently, 1%) of their allocations for leadership activities that serve individuals in state institutions (i.e., state correctional institutions, juvenile justice facilities, and educational institutions that serve individuals with disabilities); and states must reserve funds for recruitment of special populations (e.g., individuals from economically disadvantaged families) to enroll in CTE programs.   The bill repeals provisions that prohibit a state from receiving an allotment for a fiscal year that is less than its allotment received for FY1998. The use of such reserve funds are revised:  to include areas with high percentages of CTE concentrators or CTE participants, areas with high numbers of either of them, and areas with certain disparities or gaps in performance; in order to foster innovation through the identification and promotion of promising and proven CTE programs, practices, and strategies, which may include programs, practices, and strategies that prepare individuals for nontraditional fields, or promote the development, implementation, and adoption of programs of study or career pathways aligned with state-identified high-skilled, high-wage, or in-demand occupation or industries.   (Sec. 112) The bill also revises requirements for core indicators of performance, including state determined levels of performance, to differentiate those for CTE concentrators who graduate from high school and for CTE concentrators at the postsecondary level. ED may assist an eligible agency in establishing such state determined levels of performance only at the agency's request. (Sec. 113) ED shall (currently, may) carry out research, development, dissemination, evaluation, capacity building, and technical assistance for CTE programs. The bill eliminates ED assessment requirements of CTE programs. The Institute for Education Sciences shall act for ED on such evaluation and development of ED's single plan to implement certain activities regarding CTE programs. ED shall appoint an independent advisory panel to advise on the evaluation of CTE programs. The bill revises requirements for the contents of an evaluation. ED may award competitive grants to a consortium of one or more institutions of higher education, one or more private nonprofit organizations, or one or more agencies. The consortium shall include local educational agencies and area CTE schools that provide education at the secondary level, and Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or tribal education agencies that operate schools or may be present in the state. The grants shall be used for certain activities, including:  evidence-based research and evaluation to develop, improve, and identify the most successful methods to eliminate inequities in access to, and in opportunities for, learning, skill development, or effective teaching in CTE programs; research on, and evaluation of, the impact of changes made by this bill, including state-by-state comparisons of certain information; evidence-based research and analyses that provide longitudinal information with respect to CTE education programs and programs of study and student achievement; and the implementation of, evaluation of, or evidence-based research of, innovative methods that support high-quality implementation of CTE programs and CTE related programs of study and student achievement.  In addition, ED may award grants for up to three years to eligible entities, institutions, or recipients to identify, support, and rigorously evaluate evidence-based and innovative strategies and activities to improve and modernize CTE. Such grants may be used to align workforce skills with labor market needs as part of the state plan and local application under the Act and requirements of this bill. Grant priority shall be given to eligible entities, eligible institutions, or eligible recipients that predominantly serve low-income students. (Sec. 114) The bill revises specified funding-related provisions regarding Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. (Sec. 115) The bill sets forth a special rule for the use of grant funds made available to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska entities. Such funds may not be used to provide preparatory, refresher, and remedial education services designed to enable students to achieve success in CTE programs or programs of study. (Sec. 116) The bill reauthorizes through FY2024 grants for tribally controlled postsecondary CTE institutions and repeals the authorization for assistance for certain occupational and information activities. Part B--State Provisions (Sec. 121) State plans shall be for four years instead of six years. The bill revises requirements for:  such plans, as well as state program improvement plans and state leadership activities; local applications for CTE programs, including a comprehensive CTE needs assessment, and local uses of funds; and state maintenance of efforts, including administrative penalties for failure to meet maintenance requirements.   The bill permits a state, in order to receive its full fiscal year CTE funding allotment, to: (1) continue to use its existing fiscal effort per student or aggregate expenditure in determining qualifying expenditure levels, or (2) establish a new level of fiscal effort per student or aggregate expenditure. Part C--Local Provisions (Sec. 131) The bill revises requirements for local eligible recipients to receive funding for CTE programs, including: (1) submitting an application instead of an improvement plan to the eligible agency, (2) conducting a special comprehensive CTE needs assessment, and (3) the use of such funds. TITLE II--GENERAL PROVISIONS (Sec. 201) The bill eliminates funding for tech prep program activities. In order for a state to receive its full allotment of funds for any fiscal year, ED must find that the state's fiscal effort per student or its aggregate expenditures for CTE for the preceding fiscal year was at least the fiscal year per student or its aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year. A state may:  continue to use its fiscal effort per student or aggregate expenditures for CTE that was in effect before enactment of this bill, or establish a new level of such effort or expenditures that is at least 95% of the effort or expenditure for CTE for the preceding fiscal year.   ED shall reduce the amount of a state's allotment of funds for any fiscal year in the exact portion by which the state fails to meet such requirement by falling below its fiscal effort per student or aggregate expenditures for one or more of the five immediately preceding fiscal years. No funds made available under this bill may be used to:  require any secondary school student to choose or pursue a specific career pathway or program of study; or provide CTE programs or programs of study to students before the middle grades (currently, seventh grade).  Equipment and facilities purchased with such funds may be used by the students. The bill authorizes an eligible recipient to use funding for CTE program and activities, including programs of study, to allow participation in such programs and activities by secondary school students attending nonprofit private schools located in areas served by the eligible recipient. (Currently, the students must reside in such area.) (Sec. 219) The Government Accountability Office shall evaluate:  the strategies, components, policies, and practices used successfully by eligible agencies or eligible recipients receiving funding to assist all students in pursuing and completing programs of study aligned to high-skill, high-wage occupations, as well as any special population or specific subgroup of students that is underrepresented; and any challenges associated with replication of such strategies, components, policies, and practices.   TITLE III--AMENDMENTS TO OTHER LAWS  (Sec. 301) The Wagner-Peyser Act is amended to revise the duties of a state agency receiving federal assistance for participation in the nationwide employment statistics system of workforce and labor market information. (Sec. 302) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to require a state that receives funds under this bill to include in its annual report card regarding the use of such funds the number and percentage of students meeting state determined levels of performance for core indicators. Local educational agencies may not use grants received under this bill for tech prep activities. (Sec. 303) The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is amended to replace ""school dropouts"" with ""out-of-school youth"" with respect to certain career and training services provided by eligible providers through one-stop delivery systems. Such systems shall include performance information and program cost information on eligible providers of CTE activities available to out-of-school youth.","Labor and Employment",2018-07-31,0.275,0.725

Specifically, those requirements are waived if a loan: (1) is originated by and retained by the institution, (2) complies with requirements regarding prepayment penalties and points and fees, and (3) does not have negative amortization or interest-only terms. Furthermore, for such requirements to be waived, the institution must consider and verify the debt, income, and financial resources of the consumer.  The bill also provides for circumstances in which&nbsp;such requirements shall be waived with respect to a&nbsp;loan that is&nbsp;transferred: (1) by reason of bankruptcy or failure of the originating institution, (2) to a similar institution, (3) in the event of a merger, or (4) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the institution.  (Sec. 102) Mortgage appraisal services donated by a fee appraiser to an organization eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions are deemed to be customary and reasonable under TILA.  (Sec. 103) The bill&nbsp;amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989&nbsp;to&nbsp;exempt from appraisal requirements certain federally related, rural&nbsp;real-estate transactions valued below a specified limit if&nbsp;no certified appraiser is available.  (Sec. 104) The bill amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to exempt from specified public disclosure requirements depository institutions and&nbsp;credit unions that&nbsp;originate fewer than a specified number of closed-end mortgages or open-end lines of credit.  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on these changes.  (Sec. 105) The bill amends the Federal Credit Union Act to allow a credit union to extend a member business loan with respect to a one- to four-family dwelling, regardless of whether the dwelling is the member's primary residence. Under current law, a member business loan may be extended with respect to such a dwelling only if it is the member's primary residence.  (Sec. 106) The bill amends the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to revise the Act's civil liability immunity provisions and to temporarily allow loan originators that meet specified requirements to continue to originate loans after moving: (1) from one state to another, or (2) from a depository institution to a non-depository institution.  (Sec. 107) The bill amends TILA to specify that a retailer of manufactured housing that meets certain requirements is generally not a ""mortgage originator"" subject to requirements under that Act. (Sec. 108) The bill exempts from certain escrow requirements a residential mortgage loan held by a depository institution or credit union that: (1) has&nbsp;assets of $10 billion or less, (2)&nbsp;originated 1,000 or fewer mortgages in the preceding year, and (3) meets other specified requirements.  (Sec. 109) The required mortgage disclosure waiting period is eliminated with respect to a second offer of credit if the creditor offers a consumer a lower annual percentage rate in the&nbsp;second offer.  TITLE II--REGULATORY RELIEF AND PROTECTING CONSUMER ACCESS TO CREDIT (Sec. 201) Federal banking agencies must develop a specified&nbsp;Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank's equity capital to its consolidated assets) for banks with assets of less than $10 billion. Such banks that exceed this ratio&nbsp;shall be&nbsp;deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. Federal banking agencies may consider a company's risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the ratio requirement.  (Sec. 202) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exclude reciprocal deposits of an insured depository institution from certain limitations on&nbsp;prohibited broker deposits if the total reciprocal deposits of the institution do not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of its total liabilities. Reciprocal deposits are deposits that banks make with each other in equal amounts. (Generally, an insured depository institution that is not well capitalized may not accept funds obtained by or through any deposit broker for deposit.)  (Sec. 203) The bill amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to exempt from the ""Volcker Rule"" banks with: (1) total assets valued at less than $10 billion, and (2) trading assets and liabilities&nbsp;comprising not more than 5% of total assets. (The Volcker Rule prohibits banking agencies from engaging in proprietary trading or entering into certain relationships with hedge funds and private-equity funds.)  (Sec. 204) Volcker Rule restrictions on entity name sharing are eased in specified circumstances.  (Sec. 205) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require federal banking agencies to issue regulations allowing certain small depository institutions to satisfy reporting requirements with a reduced Report of Condition and Income (i.e., call report).  (Sec. 206) The bill amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to permit certain&nbsp;federal savings associations to elect to operate, subject to supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with the same rights and duties as national banks (including operating without certain lending restrictions).  (Sec. 207) The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) must increase, from $1 billion to $3 billion, the consolidated asset threshold (i.e., permissible debt level) for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that: (1) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities; (2) does not conduct significant off-balance-sheet activities; and (3) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities, other than trust-preferred securities, outstanding. If warranted for supervisory purposes, the FRB may exclude a company from this threshold increase.  (Sec. 208) The bill amends the Expedited Funds Availability Act to apply the Act, which governs bank deposit holds, to American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam.

(Sec. 212) The bill amends the Federal Credit Union Act to require the National Credit Union Administration to hold public hearings on its draft annual budget.  (Sec. 213) A financial institution is authorized to record personal information from a scan, copy, or image of an individual's driver's license or personal identification card and store the information electronically when an individual initiates an online request to open an account or obtain a financial product.

The financial institution must delete any copy or image of an individual's driver's license or personal identification card after use. (Sec. 214) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to specify that a federal banking agency may not subject a depository institution to higher capital standards with respect to a high-volatility commercial real-estate (HVCRE) exposure unless the exposure is an HVCRE acquisition, development, or construction (ADC) loan. An HVCRE ADC loan : (1) is secured by land or improved real property; (2) has the purpose of providing financing to acquire, develop, or improve the real property such that the property becomes income-producing; and (3) is dependent upon future income or sales proceeds from, or refinancing of, the real property for the repayment of the loan.  (Sec. 215) The Social Security Administration (SSA) is directed to develop a database to facilitate the verification of consumer information upon request by a certified financial institution. Such verification shall be provided only&nbsp;with the consumer's consent and in connection with a credit transaction. Users of the database shall pay system costs as determined by the SSA. (Sec. 216) The bill directs Treasury to report on the risks of cyber threats to financial institutions and capital markets.

It also: (1) requires a consumer reporting agency&nbsp;to provide a consumer with free credit freezes and to notify a consumer of their availability, (2) establishes provisions related to the placement and removal of these freezes, (3) creates requirements related to the&nbsp;protection of the credit records of minors.  (Sec. 302) The bill limits, and establishes&nbsp; a dispute process and verification procedures&nbsp;with respect to, the inclusion of&nbsp;a veteran's medical debt in a consumer credit report.  (Sec. 303) The bill extends immunity from liability to certain individuals employed at financial institutions who, in good faith and with reasonable care, disclose the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen to a regulatory or law-enforcement agency. Similarly, the employing financial institution shall not be liable with respect to disclosures made by such employees.  The bill allows financial institutions and third-party entities to offer training related to the suspected financial exploitation of a senior citizen to specified employees. The bill provides guidance regarding the content, timing, and record-maintenance requirements of such training.  (Sec. 304) The sunset provision of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act is repealed, restoring notification requirements and other protections related to the eviction of renters in foreclosed properties. (The Act expired on December 31, 2014.) (Sec. 305) Treasury may&nbsp;use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to remediate lead and asbestos hazards in residential properties.  (Sec. 306) The bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise the Family-Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program,&nbsp;an employment and savings incentive program for families that reside in public housing or have housing vouchers. Specifically, the bill:   combines existing, separately&nbsp;operated FSS programs into a single program;  extends program eligibility to tenants of certain privately owned properties&nbsp;subsidized with project-based rental assistance;  revises program requirements related to eligibility,&nbsp;supportive services, and&nbsp;escrow deposits; and  otherwise&nbsp;modifies the&nbsp;FSS program.  (Sec. 307) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is directed to promulgate ability-to-repay regulations regarding property assessed clean energy financing. (Sec. 308) The bill directs the GAO to report on the accuracy and security of consumer reporting agencies&nbsp;and consumer reports.  (Sec. 309) A refinanced home loan may not be guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), unless: (1) a specified minimum time period has passed between the original loan and the refinancing; and (2) the lender complies with provisions related to fee recoupment, mortgage interest rates, and net tangible benefit tests. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) must report on the liquidity of the VA Housing Loan Program. The VA must report annually on refinanced home loans to veterans. (Sec. 310) The bill amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to allow the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), when determining whether to purchase a residential mortgage, to consider a borrower's credit score only if certain procedural requirements are met with respect to the validation and approval of credit-scoring models. The Federal Housing Finance Agency must, by regulation, establish standards and criteria for processes used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to validate and approve credit-scoring models in accordance with the bill. (Sec. 311) The GAO is directed to report on foreclosures, homeownership, and mortgage defaults in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria. (Sec. 312) HUD must report on and provide recommendations for lead-based paint hazard prevention and abatement, with an emphasis on preventing exposure in children. (Sec. 313) The bill amends the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 to make permanent the&nbsp;one-year grace period during which a servicemember is protected from foreclosure after leaving military service.  TITLE IV--TAILORING REGULATIONS FOR CERTAIN BANK HOLDING COMPANIES  (Sec. 401) The bill amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010, with respect to nonbank financial&nbsp;companies supervised by the FRB and certain bank holding companies,&nbsp;to:  increase the asset threshold at which certain enhanced prudential standards shall apply, from $50 billion to $250 billion, while allowing the FRB discretion in determining whether a financial institution with assets equal or greater than $100 billion must be subject to such standards;  increase the asset threshold at which company-run stress tests are required, from $10 billion to $250 billion; and&nbsp; increase the asset threshold for mandatory risk committees, from $10 billion to $50 billion.  (Sec. 402) The bill requires the appropriate federal banking agencies to exclude, for purposes of calculating a custodial bank's supplementary leverage ratio, funds of a custodial bank that are deposited with a central bank. (""Supplementary leverage ratio"" is a capital adequacy measure that refers to the ratio of a banking organization's tier-one capital to its leverage exposure.) The amount of such funds may not exceed the total value of deposits of the custodial bank linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts.  (Sec. 403) This bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require certain municipal obligations to be treated as level 2B liquid assets if they are investment grade, liquid, and readily marketable. Under current law, corporate debt securities and publicly traded common-equity shares, but not municipal obligations, may be treated as level 2B liquid assets (which are considered to be high-quality assets).  TITLE V--ENCOURAGING CAPITAL FORMATION  (Sec. 501) The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from state registration securities qualified for national trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and authorized to be listed on a national securities exchange. Currently, securities listed on exchanges specified by statute or SEC rule are exempt.  (Sec. 502) The bill directs the SEC to report on the risks and benefits of algorithmic trading in capital markets. (Sec. 504) The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to exempt from the definition of an ""investment company,"" for purposes of specified limitations applicable to such a company under the Act, a qualifying venture capital fund that has no more than 250 investors. Specifically, the bill applies to a venture capital fund that has less than $10 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital. Under current law, a venture capital fund is considered to be an investment company if it has more than 100 investors. (Sec. 505) The bill requires the SEC to offset future fees and assessments due from a national securities exchange or association that: (1) has previously overpaid such fees and assessments, and (2) informs the SEC of the overpayment within 10 years. (Sec. 506) The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to apply the Act to investment companies created under the laws of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other U.S. possession. (Sec. 507) The bill requires the SEC to increase, from $5 million to $10 million, the 12-month sales threshold beyond which an issuer is required to provide investors with additional disclosures related to compensatory benefit plans. (Sec. 508) The bill expands the applicability to issuers of&nbsp;""Regulation A+"" (which exempts certain smaller offerings from securities registration requirements). (Sec. 509) The bill directs the SEC to revise registration rules to allow a closed-end company to use offering and proxy rules currently available to other issuers of securities, thereby reducing filing requirements and restrictions on communications with investors in certain circumstances. (A closed-end company is a publicly traded investment management company that sells a limited number of shares to investors in an initial public offering.) TITLE VI--PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT BORROWERS (Sec. 601) The bill amends TILA to prospectively&nbsp;revise&nbsp;provisions relating to cosigners of private student loans. Specifically, the bill: (1) prohibits a creditor from declaring a default or accelerating the debt of a private student loan on the sole basis&nbsp;of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner to such a loan, and (2) directs loan holders to release cosigners from any obligation upon the death of the student borrower.  (Sec. 602) The bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow a person to request the removal of a previously reported default regarding a private education loan from a consumer report if: (1) the lender chooses to offer a loan-rehabilitation program that requires a number of consecutive on-time monthly payments demonstrating renewed ability and willingness to repay the loan, and (2) the consumer meets those requirements. A consumer may obtain such rehabilitation benefits only once per loan. The GAO shall report on the implementation of these provisions. (Sec. 603) The bill amends the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act to direct the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to establish best practices for teaching financial literacy skills at institutions of higher education.","Finance and Financial Sector",2018-05-24,0.48,0.52

(Sec. 103) Interior or USDA, as appropriate, shall submit to Congress a request for supplemental appropriations if the amount provided for wildfire suppression operations for a fiscal year will be exhausted within 30 days. TITLE II--FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES (Sec. 202) This section amends the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to authorize certain hazardous fuels reduction projects for wildfire resilience. The section also: (1) categorically excludes the projects from requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to produce environmental assessments or environmental impact statements, and (2) exempts the projects from the special administrative review process under the Act. The projects must carry out forest restoration treatments that:  maximize the retention of old-growth and large trees to the extent that they promote stands that are resilient to insects and disease and reduce the risk or extent of, or increase resilience to, wildfires; consider the best available scientific information to maintain or restore ecological integrity; and are developed and implemented through a collaborative process that meets specified requirements.  A project under this section may carry out part of a proposal that complies with the eligibility requirements of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The section prohibits a project under this section from exceeding 3,000 acres. A project under this section shall be:  prioritized within the wildland-urban interface; if located outside the interface, limited to areas within Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Groups I, II, or III that contain very high wildfire hazard potential; and limited to landscape-scale areas in national forests that are experiencing an insect or disease epidemic and that have been designated as treatment areas under the Act as of this bill's enactment.  The section prohibits a project under this section from including the establishment of any permanent roads. USDA and Interior may carry out necessary maintenance and repairs on existing permanent roads for the purposes of this section. USDA and Interior shall decommission any temporary road constructed for a project under this section within three years of the completion of that project. Whenever using the categorical exclusion under this section, USDA and Interior must apply the extraordinary circumstances procedures relating to the categorical exclusion of certain types of proposed actions from further analysis and documentation in an Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment under the NEPA if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action. This section does not apply to:  components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, federal land on which the removal of vegetation is restricted or prohibited, congressionally designated wilderness study areas, or an area in which the activities would be inconsistent with the applicable land and resource management plan.  All projects and activities carried out under this section must be consistent with the land and resource management plan established under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 for the National Forest Service (NFS) unit containing the applicable projects and activities. USDA and Interior shall conduct public notice and scoping for any projects or actions proposed in accordance with this section. USDA and Interior shall submit to Congress and the Government Accountability Office annual reports on the use of categorical exclusions under this section. (Sec. 203) This section expands the definition for an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project to include the installation of:  a natural or manmade change in fuel characteristics that affects fire behavior such that a fire can be more readily controlled (commonly known as a fuel break), and a natural or constructed barrier used to stop or check a fire or to provide a control line from which to work to stop or check a fire (commonly known as a firebreak).  (Sec. 204) This section authorizes the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to obligate funds in stages that are economically or programmatically viable to cover any potential cancellation ceiling or termination costs with respect to an agreement or contract for a stewardship end result contracting project. The Forest Service and BLM must notify Congress 30 days before entering into a multiyear agreement or contract that includes a cancellation ceiling exceeding $25 million if proposed funding for the costs of cancelling the agreement or contract up to the ceiling is not included. The Forest Service and the BLM shall also transmit a copy of such a notice to the Office of Management and Budget. (Sec. 205) If the offset value of the forest products to be removed under stewardship contracts exceeds the value of the resource improvement treatments, the Forest Service and BLM may: (1) use the excess to satisfy any outstanding liabilities for cancelled agreements or contracts; or (2) if there are no such outstanding liabilities, apply the excess to other authorized stewardship projects. (Sec. 206) This section requires annual reports on the status of the development, implementation, and administration of agreements or contracts for authorized stewardship projects to be submitted to specified congressional committees. (Sec. 207) USDA and Interior may award contracts or agreements to enter into authorized stewardship projects for terms of up to 20 years on areas where the majority of federal lands are located in Fire Regime Groups I, II, or III. In awarding such a contract, USDA and Interior may give a procurement preference to a contractor that would promote an innovative use of forest products, including cross-laminated timber, as part of such contract. (Sec. 208) This section specifies that the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or the designation of critical habitat pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) does not require USDA to engage in certain additional consultations to update or revise an approved land and resource management plan unless: (1) 15 years have passed since USDA adopted such a plan; and (2) 5 years have passed since the later of this section's enactment, the listing of a species as threatened or endangered for a species known to occur on a unit, or the designation of critical habitat within such unit. (Sec. 209) This section prohibits the BLM from being required to engage in consultation under any law concerning the Oregon and California Railroad revested grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands, with respect to: (1) the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or a designation of a critical habitat, if a land use plan has already been adopted; and (2) any provision of such plan. (Sec. 210) The Forest Service shall:  publish a geospatial map appropriate for community-level use that depicts wildfire hazard severity to inform at-risk communities that are adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire, and disseminate such information in a web-based format.  The section states that the purposes of such map are to:  inform evaluations of wildfire risk, prioritize fuels management needs, and depict the relative potential for wildfire that could be difficult for suppression resources to contain and that could cause ignitions to structures.  (Sec. 211) Interior and USDA must issue and periodically update guidance to ensure that provisions are developed and implemented for utility vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance of rights-of-way for electricity transmission and distribution facilities. Such guidance must be compatible with the mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization (the organization) and take into account a specified memorandum of understanding on vegetation management for powerline rights-of-way. Also, such guidance shall:  be developed in consultation with the owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities that hold rights-of-way; seek to minimize the need for case-by-case approvals for routine vegetation management activities, facility inspections, operation and maintenance activities, and utility vegetation management activities necessary to control hazard trees; and provide for prompt and timely review of requests to conduct vegetation management activities that require approval by Interior or USDA, as appropriate, especially those that require expedited or immediate action.  Interior and USDA shall give facility owners and operators the option to submit a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan that meets specified requirements. Owners and operators subject to mandatory reliability standards established by the organization (or superseding standards) may use them as part of their plans. Interior and USDA shall develop jointly a consolidated and coordinated process for review and approval of these plans. Interior and USDA shall identify, with respect to the development and approval of such plans, as well as with respect to the actions carried out under them, categories of actions for which neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment shall be required under federal regulations relating to categorical exclusions under NEPA. An owner or operator of a facility that is not subject to the mandatory reliability standards established by the organization or that has sold less than or equal to 1 million megawatt hours of electric energy for purposes other than resale during each of the three years immediately preceding this section's enactment may enter into an agreement with Interior or USDA, as appropriate, instead of a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan. If vegetation or hazard trees have contacted or present an imminent danger of contacting an electric transmission or distribution line from within or adjacent to an electric transmission or distribution right-of-way, the owner or operator of such lines:  may prune or remove the vegetation or hazard tree to avoid the disruption of electric service and to eliminate immediate fire and safety hazards, and shall notify USDA or Interior no later than one day after the response to the emergency conditions.  The owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility may conduct vegetation management activities that require the approval of Interior or USDA, as appropriate, in accordance with a plan approved or an agreement entered into pursuant to this section, but only after receiving the approval of such department. Nonetheless, the owner or operator of such a facility may conduct such activities in accordance with such a plan or agreement without first getting approval if:  the owner or operator submitted a request to USDA or Interior, as appropriate, in accordance with the applicable schedule; the activities, including the removal of hazard trees, proposed in the request are in accordance with the plan or agreement; and such department failed to respond to the request in accordance with the schedule.  Interior and USDA shall not impose strict liability for damages or injury that results from Interior or USDA unreasonably: (1) withholding or delaying approval of a plan or an agreement, or (2) failing to adhere to a schedule in such a plan or agreement. For the period ending 10 years after the enactment of this section, Interior and USDA shall not impose strict liability amounting to more than $500,000 per incident for damages or injury that result from activities conducted by an owner or operator in accordance with an approved agreement. Interior and USDA shall report annually on their respective websites all such requests and actions made concerning vegetation management activities that require approval. Interior and USDA shall report to Congress on the effect on the Treasury of the strict liability limitation established by this section. Interior and USDA are encouraged to develop a program for training personnel of Interior and Forest Service, respectively, involved in vegetation management decisions related to electric transmission and distribution facilities. (Sec. 212) This section amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to include under the definition of ""forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration services,"" with respect to good neighbor agreements, the reconstruction, repair, restoration, or decommissioning of certain NFS roads as necessary to carry out authorized forest restoration services under a good neighbor agreement.. TITLE III--FEDERAL LAND TRANSACTION FACILITATION REAUTHORIZATION Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act Reauthorization of 2018 This title permanently reauthorizes and amends the authority included in the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which provides for the sale or exchange of certain Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land that has been identified for disposal under BLM land use plans. (Sec. 302) This section makes several amendments to the FLTFA. Among other changes, the amendments:  authorize current information to be used for disposal and acquisition actions, require the establishment of a publicly available database containing a comprehensive list of BLM lands available for disposal, and modify the criteria and priorities for land acquisitions.  TITLE IV--EXTENSION OF SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF 2000 (Sec. 401) This section amends the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 to reauthorize payments under the Secure Rural Schools program (SRS) for FY2017 and FY2018. This section also makes several modification to the program, which authorizes payments to certain counties with federal land as an alternative to payments based on the prior years' revenue generated on the lands. For FY2017, the full funding amount is equal to 95% of the full funding amount for FY2015. This section also specifies rules for making FY2017 payments and modifies the requirements for the allocation of SRS funds to specified projects. The section also repeals the Merchantable Timber Contracting Pilot Program. (Sec. 402) The section permits SRS payments to be used to:  reimburse the participating county for law enforcement patrols that are performed on federal land and paid for by the county; cover training costs and equipment purchases directly related to search and rescue and other emergency services, including such patrols; and carry out community wildfire protection plans.  TITLE V--STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE DRAWDOWN (Sec. 501) This section directs the Department of Energy (DOE), during FY2020-FY2021, to draw down and sell 10 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Amounts that are received from such a sale shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury during the fiscal year in which such sale occurs. DOE may not draw down and sell crude oil from the reserve in quantities that would limit the authority of DOE to sell petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prevent or reduce an adverse impact of a domestic or international energy supply shortage of significant scope or duration in the full quantities authorized by such Act.

Subdivision 2--Tax Relief and Medicaid Changes Relating To Certain Disasters  TITLE I--CALIFORNIA FIRES  This title amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow various tax credits, deductions, and modifications to existing rules for individuals and businesses affected by wildfires in California.  (Sec. 20101) A ""California wildfire disaster zone"" is the portion of the California wildfire disaster area determined by the President to warrant federal assistance under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California.  A ""California wildfire disaster area"" is an area with respect to which between January 1, 2017, through January 18, 2018, a major disaster has been declared by the President under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California.  (Sec. 20102) This section waives the 10% additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans for up to $100,000 in qualified wildfire distributions.  A ""qualified wildfire distribution"" must be made on or after October 8, 2017, and before January 1, 2019, to an individual: (1) whose principal place of abode during any portion of the period from October 8, 2017, to December 31, 2017, is located in the California wildfire disaster area, and (2) who has sustained an economic loss by reason of the wildfires to which the declaration of the area relates.  A taxpayer who has received such a distribution may: (1) repay the distribution by making additional contributions to a retirement account within three years, and (2) include the distribution in gross income by dividing the amount over a three-year period.  This section also: (1) permits individuals to recontribute funds to retirement plans if the funds were distributed for a home purchase in a California wildfire disaster area that was cancelled on account of the wildfires, and (2) increases the limit and extends the repayment deadline for loans from retirement plans.  (Sec. 20103) This section allow an employee retention tax credit for employers affected by the California wildfires. The credit is equal to 40% of the qualified wages (up to $6,000 per employee) paid to an employee whose principal place of employment on October 8, 2017, with the employer was in the California wildfire disaster zone.  ""Qualified wages"" include wages that: (1) are paid or incurred on or after October 8, 2017, and before January 1, 2018; and (2) occurred during the period that begins when the trade or business became inoperable at the principal place of employment of the employee immediately before the wildfires and ends when the trade or business has resumed significant operations.  (Sec. 20104) The section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily suspend the limitations on charitable contributions made during the period beginning on October 8, 2017, and ending on December 31, 2018, for relief efforts in the California wildfire disaster area.  The section also modifies the deduction for personal casualty losses in the California wildfire disaster areas to eliminate: (1) the requirement for losses to exceed 10% of adjusted gross income to qualify for the deduction, and (2) the requirement to itemize.  For the purposes of determining earned income for the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, certain taxpayers affected by the California wildfires may use earned income from the immediately preceding year.  TITLE II--TAX RELIEF FOR HURRICANES HARVEY, IRMA, AND MARIA  (Sec. 20201) This title amends the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 to modify the Hurricanes Harvey and Irma Disaster Areas to include areas with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by the President before October 17, 2017 (before September 21, 2017, under current law) under the Stafford Act by reasons of Hurricanes Harvey or Irma.  TITLE III--HURRICANE MARIA RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS MEDICAID PROGRAMS  (Sec. 20301) This title increases Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through FY2019. Such funding shall be further increased through 2019 for each territory if the territory takes specified actions to improve its Medicaid program. The division also increases the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for the additional funds to 100%.  TITLE IV--BUDGETARY EFFECTS  (Sec. 20401) This section designates this subdivision as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010. (This prohibits the budgetary effects of this subdivision from being counted for the purpose of PAYGO rules that prohibit certain revenue and direct spending legislation from increasing the deficit.)  (Sec. 20402) In the Senate, this subdivision is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the FY2018 congressional budget resolution. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)  Subdivision 3--Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  (Sec. 20101) This subdivision amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law).  It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing continuing resolution (CR) expired because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted.  The subdivision also:   continues funding authority to maintain the schedule and deliver the required data according to statutory deadlines in the 2020 Decennial Census Program,  makes additional funding available for the Southeastern Power Administration,  permits the Department of Energy to draw down and sell up to $350 million of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2018 and requires the proceeds to be used for the SPR modernization program,  makes additional funding available to the judiciary for juror fees,  provides additional funding for the staffing of newly opened or expanded Indian Health Service facilities,  continues Department of Education authority to make account maintenance fee payments to guaranty agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan program,  modifies existing authority to allow the Department of Education to waive cohort default rate requirements for public institutions of higher education operating in economically distressed counties,  provides authority for new construction starts for projects associated with the DOD F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program,  makes technical corrections related to the authority of the Department of Transportation to consolidate its credit programs, and  extends HUD's HOPE VI program for the duration of the CR. (The program provides funds to renovate or demolish existing public housing and replace it with mixed-income housing.)  DIVISION C--BUDGETARY AND OTHER MATTERS  TITLE I--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT  (Sec. 30101) This title amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019.  The title revises procedures for implementing the sequester of direct spending, which is required under current law and involves cuts that interact with discretionary spending levels. The title requires the sequester to take place in FY2018 and FY2019 as if the amendments that this title makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made.  It also extends the sequester for mandatory spending through FY2027 (currently through FY2025) and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare.  (Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)  (Sec. 30102) This section resets the balances on the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to zero.  (Sec. 30103) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this bill. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve funds contained in the FY2018 budget resolution updated by one fiscal year.  After April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution.  This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019.  (Sec. 30104) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the House Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this bill.  If a FY2019 congressional budget resolution has not been adopted by April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution.  The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect the budgetary effects of any legislation enacted during the 115th Congress that reduces the deficit or as otherwise necessary.  This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019.  (Sec. 30105) This section specifies that section 30103 and section 30104 are enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of each chamber. It also recognizes that each chamber has the authority to change the rules.  TITLE II--OFFSETS  (Sec. 30201) This section amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend the authority of Treasury to collect certain customs user fees.  It also amends the United States--Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act to extend the increased rate for merchandise processing fees.  (Sec. 30202) This section extends the requirement for DOT to deposit into the Treasury a portion of the aviation security service fees charged to passengers of air carriers.  (Sec. 30203) This section amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to extend certain immigration fees for: (1) using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program, and (2) L-1 (intracompany transferees) and H-1B visas (temporary workers in professions specialty occupations).  (Sec. 30204) DOE must draw down and sell specified oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2022-FY2025, FY2026, and FY2027 and deposit the proceeds in the Treasury during the fiscal year in which the sale occurs.  DOE may not draw down and sell crude oil under this section in quantities that would limit the authority to sell petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in order to prevent or reduce adverse impacts of severe domestic energy supply interruptions.  This section amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to: (1) modify the conditions for a drawdown for the SPR to require DOE to find that the action will not impair the ability of the U.S. to carry out U.S. obligations under the international energy program, and (2) prohibit a draw down when there are fewer than 450 million (currently 350 million) barrels of petroleum product stored in the SPR.  (Sec. 30205) This section amends the Federal Reserve Act to reduce the limit on the aggregate amount of the surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks from $10 million to $7.5 million. Under current law, surplus funds that exceed or would exceed the limit must be deposited into the Treasury.  (Sec. 30206) The Department of Labor must award grants for states to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for certain individuals who receive unemployment compensation.  This section also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require discretionary spending limits, committee allocations, and budget aggregates to be adjusted, subject to specified limits, for legislation that appropriates more than $117 million for a fiscal year for the grants.  TITLE III--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT  (Sec. 30301) The public debt limit is suspended through March 1, 2019. On March 2, 2019, the limit is increased to accommodate obligations issued during the suspension period.  Adjustments to the debt limit for obligations during the suspension period are limited to obligations necessary to fund a commitment incurred by the federal government that required payment before March 2, 2019. The Department of the Treasury may not issue obligations during the suspension period to increase cash balances above normal operating balances.

DIVISION B--EXTENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018  Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  (Sec. 2001) This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies through February 8, 2018 (January 19, 2018, under current law).  It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing continuing resolution (CR) expired because none of the 12 FY2018 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted.  This division also adds provisions to the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 that:    permit funds appropriated by the Department of Defense Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriations Act, 2018 to be obligated and expended notwithstanding a provision of the National Security Act of 1947 that requires a specific authorization of appropriations for intelligence activities;   provide the Department of Agriculture with funding flexibility to ensure that certain demonstration projects for providing meals to low-income children during the summer will be fully operational by May 2018;   provide the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with funding flexibility to maintain the planned launch capability schedules for the Space Launch System launch vehicle, Exploration Ground Systems, and Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle programs;   provide the Department of Energy with funding flexibility to maintain the June 30, 2017, staffing levels of the Office of Inspector General;   provide the Small Business Administration with funding flexibility to accommodate increased demand for general business loans authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act;  permit the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make certain adjustments to the Section 8 housing choice voucher annual renewal funding allocations and administrative fee eligibility determinations for public housing agencies in an area for which the President declared a disaster in 2017 or 2018 under the Robert T.

(Sec. 2002) This section amends the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to strike a provision that extended certain authorities provided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) through the duration of the CR. (The FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 was signed into law on January 19, 2018.)

In addition, the bill reauthorizes through FY2023:  the qualifying-states option (which allows states that provided coverage to now CHIP-eligible children prior to CHIP's enactment to continue to provide such coverage), and  the express-lane eligibility option (which allows states to use eligibility findings from other public benefit programs to determine children's eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP).  Beginning in FY2020, the division allows state child-health plans to adopt more restrictive eligibility standards with respect to children in families whose income exceeds 300% of the poverty line. (Sec. 102) The division extends funding through FY2023 for the Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project and the Pediatric Quality Measures Program. (Sec. 103) The division: (1) extends funding through FY2023 for specified outreach and enrollment grants, and (2) makes eligible for such grants ""parent-mentors"" who are trained to assist families with children who have no health-insurance coverage. Any nominal amount received by an individual for participation as a parent-mentor shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the individual's income-based eligibility for Medicaid. (Sec. 104) Current law provides states with an enhanced Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for child-health assistance through FY2019. The division maintains the enhanced FMAP in FY2020, but halves the percentage-point increase. (Sec. 105) The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services shall make additional funding available to states for specified activities related to mechanized claims systems. DIVISION D--SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN HEALTH-RELATED TAXES  (Sec. 4001) This section amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend for two years (2018 and 2019) the moratorium on the 2.3% excise tax on the sale of medical devices. (Under current law, the moratorium expired at the end of 2017.)  (Sec. 4002) This section amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to delay for two years the implementation of the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage (commonly referred to as the Cadillac tax). Under the bill, the tax will go into effect in 2022 instead of 2020, as required under current law.  (Sec. 4003) This section suspends for 2019 the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share.

Such procedures shall include a technical procedure whereby a record is kept of each U.S. person query term used for a query. The querying procedures shall be subject to judicial review. A court order is generally required for review by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of query results in criminal investigations unrelated to national security, except where the FBI determines there is a reasonable belief that such contents could assist in mitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm. (Sec. 102) Any information concerning a U.S. person acquired under querying provisions may not be used in evidence against that person in any criminal proceeding unless the FBI obtained an order of the FISA Court to access such information or DOJ determines that the criminal proceeding: (1) affects, involves, or is related to U.S. national security, or (2) involves death, kidnapping, serious bodily injury, conduct that constitutes a criminal offense that is a specified offense against a minor, incapacitation or destruction of critical infrastructure, cybersecurity, transnational crime, or human trafficking. Such determination is not subject to judicial review. Reporting by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is expanded. (Sec. 103) If DOJ and the ODNI intend to implement the authorization of the intentional acquisition of abouts communications, they shall first submit to specified congressional committees a written notice of intent to do so. &quot;Abouts communication&quot; means a communication that contains a reference to, but is not to or from, a target of an acquisition authorized under the FISA. Such committees shall hold hearings and briefings and otherwise obtain information in order to fully review the written notice. The bill makes an exception for emergency acquisition of abouts communication. Each element of the intelligence community involved in the acquisition of abouts communications shall fully and currently inform the committees of a material breach. (Sec. 104) The ODNI shall: (1) conduct a declassification review of any minimization procedures adopted or amended; and (2) consistent with such review, make such minimization procedures publicly available to the greatest extent practicable. (Sec. 105) If DOJ authorized the emergency employment of electronic surveillance or a physical search, DOJ may authorize, for the effective period of the emergency authorization and subsequent order, without a separate order, the targeting of a U.S. person subject to such emergency employment for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence information while such U.S. person is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. (Sec. 106) The bill provides for compensation of an amicus curiae (i.e., friend of the court who is not a party to a case and who assists the court by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case). (Sec. 107) The bill expands FISA reporting requirements to require reporting of: (1) the total number of persons subject to electronic surveillance conducted under an order or emergency authorization, including the number of such individuals who are U.S. persons; and (2) a good faith estimate of the total number of subjects who were targeted by the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device under an order or emergency authorization. (Sec. 108) The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board may meet or otherwise communicate in any number to confer or deliberate in a manner that is closed to the public. If the position of chairman of the board is vacant, the board, at the direction of the unanimous vote of the serving member of the board, may exercise the authority of the chairman. (Sec. 109) The National Security Agency and the FBI shall each designate at least one senior officer to serve as the principal advisor to carry out specified privacy and civil liberties-related functions. (Sec. 110) The bill extends whistle-blower protections to contractor employees of the intelligence community and the FBI. (Sec. 111) DOJ shall brief specified congressional committees on how it interprets FISA requirements to notify an aggrieved person of the use of information obtained or derived from electronic surveillance, physical search, or the use of a pen register or trap and trace device.  (Sec. 112) The Inspector General of DOJ shall report to specified congressional committees on queries conducted by the FBI.TITLE II--EXTENSION OF AUTHORITIES, INCREASED PENALTIES, REPORTS, AND OTHER MATTERS (Sec. 201) The bill reauthorizes title VII of the FISA until December 31, 2023. (Sec. 202) The penalty for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material is increased from one to five years. (Sec. 203) DOJ must report to specified congressional committees on current and future challenges to the effectiveness of U.S. foreign intelligence surveillance activities authorized under the FISA.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. It also establishes an oil and gas leasing program for the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.  (Unless otherwise specified, provisions referred to in this summary as temporary or as a suspension of an existing provision apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.)  TITLE I Subtitle A-- Individual Tax Reform  Part I--Tax Rate Reform  (Sec. 11001) This section temporarily replaces the existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with new brackets (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% , 37%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket.  The bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the Department of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as a head of household.  (Sec. 11002) This section requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation.  Part II--Deduction For Qualified Business Income Of Pass-Thru Entities  (Sec. 11011) This section temporarily allows an individual taxpayer to deduct 20% of qualified business income (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates), including aggregate qualified Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, qualified cooperative dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income.  The bill specifies formulas for determining the taxpayer's deduction for qualified business income and for determining the deduction for certain agricultural or horticultural cooperatives.  The deduction applies to taxable income, is not used to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI), and is available to taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction.  The bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits. The limits are fully phased in when taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts by $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns).  A &quot;specified service trade or business&quot; is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment management trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities. The term excludes engineering and architecture services.  (Sec. 11012) This section temporarily prohibits taxpayers other than corporations from claiming excess business losses.  An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus $250,000 (200% of the amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation after 2018.  In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner's distributive share and each S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership or S corporation are taken into account in applying the limitation under the provision for the taxable year of the partner or S corporation shareholder.  Losses prohibited under this section are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer's net operating loss carryforward in subsequent taxable years.  Part III--Tax Benefits For Families And Individuals  (Sec. 11021) This section temporarily increases the standard deduction to $24,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,000 for all other taxpayers. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation after 2018 using the chained CPI.  (Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.)  (Sec. 11022) This section modifies the child tax credit to temporarily: (1) increase the credit to $2,000 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and (2) allow a $500 nonrefundable credit for each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17.  The credit is phased out at AGI levels of $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $200,000 for individuals.  The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,400 per qualifying child. In order to receive the credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. The requirement does not apply to a non-child dependent for whom the $500 non-refundable credit is claimed.  (Sec. 11023) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitation for contributions of cash to public charities. (Sec. 11024) This section temporarily increases contribution limitations for ABLE accounts with respect to contributions made by the designated beneficiary of the account. (Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.)  After the limit is reached, the designated beneficiary may contribute an additional amount up to the lesser of: (1) the federal poverty line for a one-person household, or (2) the individual's compensation for the taxable year.  The bill also allows the designated beneficiary of an ABLE account to claim the saver's credit for contributions made to his or her account.  (Sec. 11025) This section allows funds from qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans) to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of the 529 account or a member of the designated beneficiary's family.  (Sec. 11026) This section temporarily allows certain members of the Armed Forces in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt to receive combat zone tax benefits for performing services that qualify for special pay for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger.  (Sec. 11027) For 2017 and 2018, this section reduces from 10% to 7.5% the AGI threshold that must be exceeded before a taxpayer is allowed to claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses.  (Sec. 11028) This section provides tax incentives for areas in which a major disaster was declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act during calendar year 2016.  For individuals residing in the 2016 disaster areas, the bill allows: (1) exceptions to the 10% penalty for up to $100,000 in early withdrawals from retirement plans, and (2) personal casualty losses exceeding $500 per casualty to be deducted without regard to whether aggregate net losses exceed 10% of a taxpayer's AGI.

(Sec. 11042) This section temporarily limits individual deductions for certain state and local taxes to $10,000 per year ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The limit does not apply to taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income.  (Sec. 11043) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) temporarily limit the deduction for debt incurred on or before December 15, 2017, to mortgages of up to $750,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) suspend the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans.  For taxable years beginning after 2025, the deduction applies to mortgages of up to $1 million regardless of when the indebtedness was incurred.  (Sec. 11044) This section temporarily modifies the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. A taxpayer may only claim the deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster. The bill includes an exception for certain personal casualty losses that do not exceed personal casualty gains.  (Sec. 11045) This section suspends all miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2% floor under present law.

(Sec. 11049) This section suspends the deduction for moving expenses.  (Sec. 11050) This section temporarily modifies a provision that limits the deduction for wagering losses to the extent of the gains from such transactions.

(Sec. 11051) This section repeals the deduction for alimony or separate maintenance payments from the payor spouse and the corresponding inclusion of the payments in the gross income of the recipient spouse.  Part VI--Increase In Estate And Gift Tax Exemption  (Sec. 11061) This section doubles the estate and gift tax exemption amount for decedents dying or gifts made after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, by increasing the basic exclusion amount from $5 million to $10 million. (Under current law, the amount is indexed for inflation occurring after 2011.)  Part VII--Extension Of Time Limit For Contesting IRS Levy  (Sec. 11071) This section extends from nine months to two years the time limit for contesting an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levy, including the time periods for: (1) returning the monetary proceeds from the sale of property that has been wrongfully levied upon, and (2) bringing a civil action for a wrongful levy.

Subtitle B--Alternative Minimum Tax  (Sec. 12001) This section repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).  (Sec. 12002) This section modifies the AMT credit for corporations to: (1) allow the AMT credit to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, and (2) make the credit refundable for any taxable year beginning after 2017 and before 2022 in an amount equal to 50% (100% beginning in 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability.  (Under current law a corporation subject to the AMT in any year is allowed an AMT credit in any subsequent taxable year to the extent that the taxpayer's regular tax liability exceeds its tentative minimum tax in the subsequent year.)  (Sec. 12003) This section temporarily increases both the exemption amount and the exemption amount phaseout thresholds for the individual AMT. The exemption amount is increased to $109,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return (half this amount for married taxpayers filing a separate return), and $70,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The phaseout thresholds are increased to $1 million for married taxpayers filing a joint return, and $500,000 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The amounts are indexed for inflation after 2018. Subtitle C--Business-related Provisions  Part I--Corporate Provisions  (Sec. 13001) This section reduces the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% under the existing graduated rate structure to a flat 21% rate for tax years beginning after 2017. The bill specifies requirements for taxpayers subject to the normalization method of accounting.  (Sec. 13002) With respect to the deduction for corporations that receive dividends from other taxable corporations, the bill reduces the 70% dividends received deduction to 50% and the 80% dividends received deduction to 65% to account for the lower corporate tax rate.  Part II--Small Business Reforms  (Sec. 13101) This section expands the expensing of certain depreciable business assets that is currently permitted under section 179 of the IRC.  The bill modifies section 179 to:    increase the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense per year to $1 million (currently $500,000);   increase the phaseout threshold for the cost of section 179 property placed in service during the year to $2.5 million (currently $2 million);   index the amounts above and the existing $25,000 limit for sport utility vehicles for inflation;   revise the definition of qualified real property eligible for section 179 expensing to include any qualified improvement property and certain improvements to nonresidential real property placed in service after the date such property was first placed in service (roofs; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning property; fire protection and alarm systems; and security systems); and   expand the definition of section 179 property to include certain depreciable tangible personal property used predominantly to furnish lodging or in connection with furnishing lodging.   (Sec. 13102) This section modifies the accounting rules for small businesses to:   expand the group of taxpayers who qualify for the cash accounting method by increasing the limit for the gross receipts test from $5 million to $25 million (adjusted for inflation after 2018),   allow any farming C corporation (or farming partnership with a C corporation partner) that meets the gross receipts test to use the cash method of accounting,   exempt taxpayers that meet the gross receipts test from certain requirements to account for inventories,   expand the exceptions for small businesses from the uniform capitalization rules to include any producer or reseller that meets the gross receipts test, and   expand the exception for small construction contracts from the requirement to use the percentage-of-completion method.   Part III--Cost Recovery And Accounting Methods  Subpart A--Cost Recovery  (Sec. 13201) This section temporarily allows increased expensing of the costs of certain business property.  The bill allows 100% expensing for: (1) certain business property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023 (January 1, 2024 for longer production period property and certain aircraft); and (2) specified plants that bear fruits or nuts and are planted or grafted after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.  The 100% allowance is phased down by 20% per year calendar year for property placed in service, and specified plants planted or grafted, in taxable years beginning after 2022 (after 2023 for longer production period property and certain aircraft).  The bill also:    expands the definition of &quot;qualified property&quot; eligible for expensing to include certain film, television, and live theatrical productions;   removes the requirement that the original use of qualified property must commence with the taxpayer, subject to certain acquisition requirements and anti-abuse rules; and   excludes from the definition of &quot;qualified property&quot; the property of certain businesses that are not subject to the limitation on interest expenses.   (Sec. 13202) This section increases the depreciation limits that apply to luxury automobiles. It also removes computer or peripheral equipment from the definition of listed property that is subject to additional restrictions and substantiation requirements regarding the expense and business usage of the property.  (Sec. 13203) This section modifies the depreciation rules for certain farm property to: (1) shorten the recovery period from seven to five years for any machinery or equipment (other than any grain bin, cotton ginning asset, fence, or other land improvement) used in a farming business, the original use of which commences with the taxpayer and is placed in service after December 31, 2017; and (2) repeal the requirement to use the 150% declining balance method for property used in a farming business.  (Sec. 13204) This section modifies the applicable recovery periods for depreciating certain real property.  The bill eliminates the separate definitions of qualified leasehold improvement, qualified restaurant, and qualified retail improvement property and applies the straight line method to qualified improvement property. It also modifies the alternative depreciation system (ADS) recovery period for such property.  (Under current law, &quot;qualified improvement property&quot; is any improvement to an interior portion of a building which is nonresidential real property if such improvement is placed in service after the date such building was first placed in service. It does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to: the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, or the internal structural framework of the building.)  A real property trade or business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest must use the ADS to depreciate nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property.  (Sec. 13205) This section requires a farming business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest to use the ADS to depreciate any property with a recovery period of 10 years or more.  (Sec. 13206) This section adjusts the amortization rules and schedules for certain research and experimentation expenditures.  (Sec. 13207) This section allows expensing of certain costs of replanting lost or damaged citrus plants lost by reason of casualty.  Subpart B--Accounting Methods  (Sec. 13221) This section revises the rules associated with the timing of the recognition of income.  Part IV--Business-Related Exclusions And Deductions  (Sec. 13301) This section limits the deduction for business interest to the sum of: (1) business interest income for the year, (2) 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and (3) the floor plan financing interest of the taxpayer for the taxable year.  The amount of any business interest not allowed as a deduction for any year may be carried forward indefinitely, with the exception of partnerships which are subject to additional carryforward rules specified in the bill.  &quot;Business interest income&quot; is the amount of interest includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which is properly allocable to a trade or business. It does not include investment income.  &quot;Floor plan financing interest&quot; is interest paid on debt used to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale or lease and secured by the inventory so acquired.  The bill includes exceptions for:    small businesses that meet the gross receipts test,   the trade or business of performing services as an employee,   any electing farming business,   any electing real property trade or business, and   certain regulated public utilities.   (Sec. 13302) This section modifies the net operating loss deduction to: (1) limit the deduction to 80% of taxable income with an exception for property and casualty insurance companies, (2) repeal the two-year and other specified carryback provisions, (3) allow an indefinite carryforward of net operating losses, and (4) allow a two-year carryback for certain losses incurred in the trade or business of farming.  (Sec. 13303) This section modifies the rule providing for the nonrecognition of gain in the case of like-kind exchanges to limit the application of the rule to real property that is not held primarily for sale.  (Sec. 13304) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain expenses for entertainment and fringe benefits.  The bill denies deductions for amounts paid or incurred for:    an activity generally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation;   membership dues for any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes;   a facility or portion thereof used in connection with any of the above items;   providing any qualified transportation fringe to employees of the taxpayer; or   providing transportation for commuting between the employee's residence and place of employment, except as necessary for ensuring the safety of the employee.   Under current law, taxpayers may deduct 50% of the food and beverage expenses associated with operating their trade or business, subject to certain exceptions. The bill temporarily expands the 50% limitation to include expenses of an employer associated with providing food and beverages through an eating facility that meets the requirements for a de minimis fringe.  (Sec. 13305) This section repeals the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities.  (Sec. 13306) This section prohibits deductions for trade or business expenses for any amount paid or incurred (whether by suit, agreement, or otherwise) to, or at the direction of, a government or governmental entity in relation to the violation of any law or the investigation or inquiry by such government or entity into the potential violation of any law.  The bill includes exceptions for amounts constituting restitution or paid to come into compliance with law, amounts paid or incurred as a result of certain court orders, and taxes due.  The bill also establishes reporting requirements for government entities with respect to certain fines, penalties, and other amounts.  (Sec. 13307) This section prohibits a tax deduction for trade or business expenses paid or incurred for: (1) any settlement or payment related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse if such settlement or payment is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, or (2) attorney's fees related to such a settlement or payment.  (Sec. 13308) This section eliminates the deduction for lobbying expenditures to influence the legislation of any local council or similar governing body, including an Indian tribal government.  (Sec. 13309) This section requires a three-year holding period (one year under current law) for certain net long-term capital gains with respect to partnership interests held in connection with the performance of investment services. If the holder of an applicable partnership interest is allocated gain from the sale of property held for less than three years, that gain is treated as short-term capital gain and is taxed as ordinary income.  (Sec. 13310) This section prohibits cash, gift cards, and other non-tangible personal property from being considered tax deductible employee achievement awards.  (Under current law, tangible personal property may be considered a deductible employee achievement award if other specified requirements are met.) The bill specifies that &quot;tangible personal property&quot; does not include: (1) cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements conferring only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited array of such items pre-selected or pre-approved by the employer); or (2) vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items.  (Sec. 13311) This section eliminates the deduction for living expenses incurred by Members of Congress. (Under current law, the deduction is limited to $3,000 per year.)  (Sec. 13312) This section modifies the exclusion from gross income for contributions to the capital of a corporation to specify that a contribution to capital does not include a contribution: (1) in aid of construction or any other contribution as a customer or potential customer, or (2) by any governmental entity or civic group (other than a contribution made by a shareholder as such).  The bill includes an exception for certain contributions made by a governmental entity pursuant to a master development plan.  (Sec. 13313) This section repeals a provision that permits the tax-free rollover of certain gains from the sale of publicly traded securities into common stock or a partnership interest in a specialized small business investment company.  (Sec. 13314) This section excludes certain patents, inventions, models, designs, secret formulas, or processes created by the taxpayer from the definition of a ''capital asset.''  Part V--Business Credits  (Sec. 13401) This section modifies the tax credit for clinical testing expenses incurred in testing certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions (commonly referred to as orphan drugs) to reduce the credit rate to 25% (currently 50%) of qualified clinical testing expenses.  (Sec. 13402) This section modifies the tax credit for rehabilitation expenditures to repeal the 10% credit for rehabilitated buildings other than a certified historic structure.  The bill retains and modifies the 20% credit for rehabilitation expenditures for certified historic structures. For the five-year period beginning in the year in which a qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service, the credit is equal to the ratable share for each year, which is 20% of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to the building, as allocated ratably to each year during the period.  (Sec. 13403) This section allows employers to claim a general business credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to employees during any period in which such employees are on family and medical leave if the rate of payment under the program is 50% of the wages normally paid to an employee.  The credit is increased by 0.25% (but not above 25%) for each percentage point by which the rate of payment exceeds 50%. The maximum amount of family and medical leave that may be taken into account with respect to any employee for any taxable year is 12 weeks.  (Sec. 13404) This section repeals the authority to issue tax-credit bonds and direct-pay bonds.  Part VI--Provisions Related To Specific Entities And Industries  Subpart A--Partnership Provisions  (Sec. 13501) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of gains or losses of foreign persons from the sale or exchange of interests in partnerships engaged in trade or business within the United States.  Under the bill, gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that the transferor would have had effectively connected gain or loss had the partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange.  A partner's distributive share of gain or loss on the deemed sale must be determined in the same manner as the partner's distributive share of the non-separately stated taxable income or loss of the partnership.  The bill also sets forth withholding requirements with respect to amounts realized from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest.  (Sec. 13502) This section modifies the definition of &quot;substantial built-in loss&quot; with respect to the transfer of an interest in partnership. The bill specifies that &quot;a substantial built-in loss&quot; also exists if the transferee partner would be allocated a loss of more than $250,000 if the partnership assets were sold for cash equal to their fair market value immediately after such transfer.  (Sec. 13503) This section modifies the basis limitation on a partner's distributive share of a partnership loss to require a partner's distributive share of partnership charitable contribution and taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and U.S. possessions to be taken into account in determining the limitation.  (Sec. 13504) This section repeals the rule that provides for a technical termination of partnerships if, within any 12-month period, there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits.  Subpart B--Insurance Reforms  (Sec. 13511) This section repeals the operations loss deduction for life insurance companies and allows the net operating loss deduction under section 172 of the IRC.  (Sec. 13512) This section repeals the small life insurance company deduction.  (Sec. 13513) This section revises the tax treatment of income or loss resulting from a change in the method of computing life insurance company reserves. The bill eliminates the 10-year period for taking into account the changes and requires the changes to be taken into account as adjustments attributable to a change in the method of accounting.  (Sec. 13514) This section repeals the special rule for distributions to shareholders of a stock life insurance company from a pre-1984 policyholders surplus account, which provides that amounts in the account are not taxed unless the amounts are treated as distributed to shareholders or subtracted from the account. The bill requires a life insurance company with such an account to pay taxes on the balance of the account ratably over the first eight taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.  (Sec. 13515) This section modifies the proration rules for property and casualty insurance companies to replace the 15% reduction with a reduction equal to 5.25% divided by the highest corporate tax rate in effect. (Under the top corporate rate of 21% that takes effect in 2018, the proration percentage is 25%.)  (Under the proration rules, in calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property or casualty insurance company must reduce the amount of the losses incurred by a specified percentage of: (1) the insurer's tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received, and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts the company owns.)  (Sec. 13516) This section repeals the special estimated tax payment rules for insurance companies.  (Sec. 13517) This section modifies the rules for computing life insurance tax reserves that are used in determining the taxable income of a life insurance company.  (Sec. 13518) This section modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing dividends received deductions and reserve deductions with respect to untaxed income. For purposes of the life insurance proration rule, the company's share is 70% and the policyholder's share is 30%.  (Sec. 13519) This section modifies the requirements for the capitalization of policy acquisition expenses of insurance companies to extend the amortization period from 120 months to 180 months.  Under current law, policy acquisition expenses are determined as that portion of the insurance company's general deductions for the taxable year that does not exceed a specified percentage of the net premiums for the year on each of three categories of insurance contracts.  The bill increases these percentages from 1.75% to 2.09% for annuity contracts, from 2.05% to 2.45% for group life insurance contracts, and from 7.7% to 9.2% for all other specified insurance contracts.  (Sec. 13520) This section establishes reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts in a reportable policy sale. It also imposes reporting requirements on the payor in the case of the payment of reportable death benefits.  A &quot;reportable policy sale&quot; is the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract.  (Sec. 13521) This section sets forth requirements for the determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. The bill specifies that no basis adjustment shall be made for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges incurred under an annuity or life insurance contract.  (Sec. 13522) This section exempts the transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, in a reportable policy sale from the transfer for valuable consideration rule.  (Under current law, the transfer for valuable consideration rule provides that, if a life insurance contract or an interest in a contract is transferred for a valuable consideration, the tax exclusion for amounts received under a life insurance contract due to the death of the insured is limited to the sum of the actual value of the consideration and the premiums and other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee.)  (Sec. 13523) This section modifies the reserve discounting rules applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to: (1) modify the interest rate used to discount unpaid losses, (2) modify the computational rules for loss payment pattern, and (3) repeal the election to use a taxpayer's historical loss payment pattern.  Subpart C--Banks and Financial Instruments  (Sec. 13531) This section limits the deduction for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums for certain financial institutions with consolidated assets that exceed $10 billion.  (Sec. 13532) This section repeals the exclusion from gross income for interest on a bond issued to advance refund another bond.  Subpart D--S Corporations  (Sec. 13541) This section allows a nonresident alien individual to be a qualifying beneficiary of an electing small business trust (ESBT), which is a type of trust that is permitted to hold shares in an S corporation.  (Sec. 13542) This section specifies that the charitable contribution deduction of an ESBT is determined by the rules applicable to individuals rather than the rules applicable to trusts, except that the deductions for costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust shall be treated as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income.  (Sec. 13543) This section modifies the tax treatment of S corporation conversions to C corporations.  Part VII--Employment  Subpart A--Compensation  (Sec. 13601) This section modifies a provision that limits the deduction for compensation of covered employees of a publicly held corporation to salaries of no more than $1 million per year. The bill: (1) repeals the performance-based compensation and commission exceptions, (2) modifies the definition of &quot;covered employee,&quot; and (3) expands the definition of &quot;publicly held corporation.&quot;  The bill includes an exception for compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date.  (Sec. 13602) This section imposes an excise tax on excess tax-exempt organization executive compensation. The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill.  (Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer.  Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years.  (Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation.  Subpart B--Retirement Plans  (Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA.  (Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan.  (Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.)  The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017.  In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation.  (Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A &quot;qualified plan loan offset amount&quot; is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant.  Part VIII--Exempt Organizations  (Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities.  (Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income.  (Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility.  (Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights.  (Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization.  Part IX--Other Provisions  Subpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform  (Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period. This section does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019.  (Sec. 13802) This section lowers the excise tax rate on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or imported by the importer.  For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to the importer, subject to specified requirements.  (Sec. 13803) This section allows the transfer of beer between bonded facilities without payment of tax if specified requirements are met.  (Sec. 13804) This section modifies the credit against the excise tax on wine for small domestic for 2018 and 2019 to:    make the credit available to all wine producers and importers by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation;  establish credit rates of: (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine;   establish adjusted credit rates for hard cider; and   make sparkling wine producers and importers eligible for the credit.   The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements.  (Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon.  (Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for &quot;mead&quot; and &quot;low alcohol by volume wine&quot; that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine.  (Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter.  Members of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates.  (Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax. This provision applies to distilled spirits transferred in bond after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2020.  Subpart B--Miscellaneous Provisions  (Sec. 13821) This section modifies the tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to: (1) allow an Alaska Native Corporation to assign certain payments referenced in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to a trust without including the payments in the gross income of the corporation, (2) allow the corporation to elect annually to deduct contributions made to a trust, (3) allow a trust to elect to defer the recognition of gains related to contributions of property other than cash until the sale or exchange of the property, and (4) establish information reporting requirements for deductible contributions to a trust.  (Sec. 13822) This section exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air.  (Sec. 13823) This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held.  Subtitle D--International Tax Provisions  Under current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes.  Part I--Outbound Transactions  Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income  (Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations.  A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).  No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section.  The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction.  (Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception.  (Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation.  For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation.  The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes.  The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings.  The tax may be paid in installments over eight years.  The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts.  Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income  Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income  (Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income.  (Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill.  Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions  (Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income.  (Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments  (Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation.  (Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation.  (Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply.  Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion  (Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of &quot;intangible property&quot; to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual.  The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property.  The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property.  (Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity.  A &quot;disqualified related party amount&quot; is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill.  A &quot;hybrid transaction&quot; is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax.  A &quot;hybrid entity&quot; is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill  (Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends.  Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System  (Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion.  (Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries.  (Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property.  (Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source.  A &quot;Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss.  Part II--Inbound Transactions  (Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax.  An &quot;applicable taxpayer&quot; is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers).  Part III--Other Provisions  (Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities.  (Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income.  TITLE II  (Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.  The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain. Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons.  Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program.  (Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.  (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury.  DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage.

(Expanded access, also known as compassionate use, allows patients to be treated with an investigational drug outside of a clinical trial.) The FDA must streamline review by institutional review boards of expanded access protocols for individual patients. The manufacturer or distributor of an investigational drug for a serious condition must publish its expanded access policy not later than 15 days after the drug is designated a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy. (Sec. 611) The bill revises the priority review program for medications for tropical diseases to limit eligibility to applications that include new clinical investigations that were not submitted as part of an application in certain foreign countries. TITLE VII--DEVICE INSPECTION AND REGULATORY IMPROVEMENTS (Sec. 701) The bill revises provisions regarding FDA inspections of establishments that manufacture or process medical devices. The biannual inspection schedule for medical device establishments handling higher risk devices is replaced with a risk-based schedule. In establishing the risk-based schedule, the FDA must consider an establishment's participation in international medical device audit programs. (Sec. 702) The FDA must adopt uniform processes and standards for inspections of domestic and foreign medical device establishments. Upon request, the FDA must provide to the person in charge of a medical device establishment feedback regarding the person's proposals to address certain issues identified during an inspection. (Sec. 703) The bill extends through FY2022 accreditation by the FDA of third parties to conduct inspections of medical device establishments. (Sec. 704) The bill revises provisions regarding FDA certification of medical devices for export. The FDA must provide the basis for denying requests for certification of products for export as meeting FDA requirements for domestic products. A person denied such a certification may request supervisory review of that decision. Products from a medical device establishment that an inspector found to be contaminated or insanitary may be certified for export if the person in charge of the establishment has agreed to a plan to correct the issues identified during the inspection. (Sec. 705) The FDA may recognize auditing organizations that are recognized by organizations established by governments to facilitate international harmonization for purposes of inspecting medical device establishments. (Sec. 706) The FDA may approve or classify a medical imaging device intended to be used with an approved contrast agent if differences from the approved use of the contrast agent do not adversely affect the safety and effectiveness of the contrast agent. (Contrast agents are substances used to enhance the visibility of body structures in medical imaging.) The FDA center that reviews medical devices has primary jurisdiction over such reviews. After authorization of a medical imaging device that makes new use of a contrast agent, the sponsor of the approved contrast agent may submit a supplemental application for the new use of the contrast agent. (Sec. 707) The bill revises how accessories to medical devices are classified. The FDA must classify accessories based on the risks when used as intended and the level of regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Applications for approval or clearance of a medical device used with an unclassified accessory may request that the FDA classify the accessory. The FDA's response to the application must grant or deny the request for classification of the accessory. The FDA must periodically classify suitable medical device accessories that have been approved for marketing as low risk devices. Manufacturers and importers of accessories approved for marketing may request classification of the accessories. (Sec. 708) In order to provide timely and reliable information on the safety and effectiveness of medical devices that have been approved, cleared, or classified, the FDA must support pilot projects that use electronic health data to generate safety and active surveillance data and inform methods and programs to support safety and active surveillance activities. (Sec. 709) The FDA must categorize certain hearing aids as over-the-counter hearing aids and issue regulations regarding those hearing aids. The regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids must: (1) provide reasonable assurances of safety and efficacy; (2) establish output limits and labeling requirements; and (3) describe requirements for the sale of hearing aids in-person, by mail, or online, without a prescription. The FDA must determine whether premarket notification is required for over-the-counter hearing aids to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. State and local governments may not establish or continue in effect requirements specifically applicable to hearing products that are not identical to FDA requirements and that restrict or interfere with the servicing or sale of over-the-counter hearing aids. The FDA must update and finalize its draft guidance on hearing products. The guidance must clarify which products are medical devices. (Sec. 710) The FDA must report on the continued quality, safety, and effectiveness of medical devices after servicing. The report must contain information including the current authority of the FDA to regulate medical device servicing and how the FDA could improve its regulation of servicing. TITLE VIII--IMPROVING GENERIC DRUG ACCESS (Sec. 801) The FDA must prioritize review of, and act within eight months of submission on, generic drug applications for drugs for which there is a shortage or for which there are not more than three approved products and no blocking patents or exclusivities. To be eligible for priority review, an applicant must submit, at least 60 days in advance of the application, information to the FDA on facilities involved in the manufacturing and testing of the drug. The FDA may expedite inspection of such manufacturing facilities. The FDA must publish a list of brand name drugs for which all patents and exclusivities have expired and no generic drug application has been approved. (Sec. 802) Upon request, the FDA must provide review status updates to applicants with pending generic drug applications. (Sec. 803) The FDA may, upon the request of an applicant for approval of a generic drug, designate a generic drug as a competitive generic therapy and expedite the development and review of the application. A drug may be designated as a competitive generic therapy if there is not more than one approved, marketed drug that is the same drug. (Sec. 804) Holders of approved brand name or generic drug applications must notify the FDA: (1) 180 days prior to withdrawing a drug from sale, or as soon as practicable, and provide specified information including the reason for withdrawal; (2) within 180 days of approval of a drug if the drug will not be available for sale within 180 days of approval and provide specified information including the reason the drug is not for sale; and (3) within 180 days of enactment of this bill of whether their drugs on the FDA&rsquo;s list of marketed drugs are marketed. The FDA must update its list of marketed drugs based on this information. (Sec. 805) The FDA must annually report information regarding petitions for permission to seek approval for a generic drug application for a drug that differs from the brand name drug. (Sec. 806) The FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain drug applications, including applications for drugs in a shortage or drugs for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. (Sec. 807) The FDA must report quarterly on generic drug applications, including information regarding applications subject to priority review or expedited development and review and withdrawals of generic drug applications. (Sec. 808) First approved applicants for a competitive generic therapy are granted a 180-day marketing exclusivity period. There may be only one such period for a drug. This exclusivity period is forfeited by an applicant if the applicant fails to market the drug within 75 days after approval. (Sec. 809) For FY2013-FY2017, the GAO must report on the rate of approval of generic drug applications upon completion of the FDA's first review of an application. For years when the rate is below 20%, the GAO must report on the reasons for the low rate. The GAO must report on whether there are ways the generic drug review process could be improved to increase the rate of approvals upon first review. TITLE IX--ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS (Sec. 902) The FDA must annually publish information regarding the past year&rsquo;s inspections of drug or medical device facilities, including the amount of time between steps in the inspection process. (Sec. 903) The bill revises requirements for performance reports under user fee provisions for prescription drugs, medical devices, generic drugs, and biosimilars, including to require quarterly publication of information regarding guidance and meetings. Performance reports must include: (1) an analysis of changes in the number of full time equivalents hired under user fee agreements and the number funded under the FDA budget, (2) an analysis of changes in user fee revenue amounts and review costs, and (3) the number of employees in specified FDA offices for whom time reporting is required and the number for whom it is not required. (Sec. 904) User fee performance reports must include an analysis of: (1) the number of product applications filed and approved, (2) whether the relevant FDA review office has met performance enhancement goals, and (3) circumstances affecting the ability of the FDA to meet review time and performance enhancement goals. The FDA must annually submit a corrective action report to Congress as part of user fee reporting. If the FDA determines that fiscal year goals were met, the report must include recommendations on ways to improve the product review process. If goals were not met, the report must include a description of the circumstances under which goals were missed and efforts to improve the FDA&rsquo;s ability to meet the goals. Each fiscal year, as requested, representatives of the FDA must meet with members of Congress and participate in a congressional hearing regarding user fee reports. (Sec. 905) The GAO must report on FDA expenses related to facility maintenance and renovation for FY2012-FY2019. The report must include an analysis of the FDA&rsquo;s ability to further its public health mission and review medical products by incurring such expenses. Beginning FY2024, the bill prohibits the use of user fees for: (1) maintenance, renovation, and repair of facilities; and (2) acquisition, maintenance, and repair of materials and supplies that are not necessary scientific equipment.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 TITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS (Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for FY2017 for:    exploration;   space operations;   science;   aeronautics;   space technology;   education;   safety, security, and mission services;   construction and environmental compliance and restoration; and   the NASA Inspector General.  TITLE II--SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS (Sec. 201) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that NASA should be a multi-mission space agency and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.  TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT (Sec. 301) The bill states that the primary objectives of the International Space Station (ISS) program shall be to:  achieve the long-term goal and objectives for human space flight and exploration as specified in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, and  pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the nation.    The bill restates that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.  In furthering such policy, NASA shall:  pursue international, commercial, and intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply, maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize U.S. operations costs relating to the ISS; utilize the ISS for the development of capabilities and technologies needed for the future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and  utilize the ISS for Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.   (Sec. 302) It is the sense of Congress that:   NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012, and  the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be continued so as to leverage state and private investments to achieve such program's goals.   Congress reaffirms:  its commitment to the use of a commercially developed, private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew missions; and  the requirement that NASA shall make use of U.S. commercially provided ISS crew transfer and crew rescue services.   The federal government may not acquire human space flight transportation services from a foreign entity unless:  there is no U.S. government-operated human space flight capability available, there is no U.S. commercial provider available, and  it is a qualified foreign entity.   The bill declares that nothing in this section shall prevent NASA from negotiating or entering into human space flight transportation arrangements with foreign entities to ensure safety of flight and continued ISS operations.  The bill states that the objective of the Commercial Crew Program shall be to assist in the development and certification of commercially provided transportation that can: (1) carry U.S. government astronauts safely, reliably, and affordably to and from the ISS; (2) serve as a crew rescue vehicle; and (3) accomplish those goals as soon as practicable. Such objective shall be the primary consideration in the acquisition strategy for such program.  NASA shall protect the safety of government astronauts by ensuring that each commercially provided transportation system under the Commercial Crew Program meets all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.  Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, NASA shall ensure that safety and the minimization of the probability of loss of crew are the critical priorities of such program.  NASA shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed the Commercial Resupply Services Program.  The bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, and to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA, NASA shall procure services for federal government access to and return from the ISS by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts.  NASA shall, in a manner that does not add costs or schedule delays to the Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services programs, ensure that all providers of such programs furnish evidence-based support for their costs and schedules. NASA shall submit to Congress a report:  identifying the lessons learned to date from previous and existing Commercial Resupply Services contracts, indicating whether changes are needed as to the manner in which NASA procures and manages similar services prior to the issuance of future Commercial Resupply Services procurement opportunities, and  identifying any lessons learned from the Commercial Resupply Services contracts that should be applied to the procurement and management of commercially provided crew transfer services to and from the ISS or to other future procurements.  (Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA could be one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit non-governmental human space flight enterprise. NASA shall submit biennial reports until 2023 which include:   a description of the progress NASA is making in achieving its deep space human exploration objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space; steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit;  identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit; the cost estimates for extending operations of the ISS to 2024, 2028, and 2030; evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility; and the impact on deep space exploration capabilities, including a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, if the preferred service life of the ISS is extended beyond 2024 and NASA maintains a flat budget profile.   The bill defines &quot;cis-lunar space&quot; as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon.  If additional government crew, power, and transportation resources are available after meeting NASA's requirements for ISS activities as defined in the Human Exploration Roadmap to be developed pursuant to section 432 of this bill and related research, demonstrations identified in the biennial reports may:  test the capabilities needed to meet future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives described in such reports; and  demonstrate or test capabilities, including those for commercial modules or deep space habitats, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, orbital satellite assembly, and exploration space suits.  (Sec. 304) NASA shall develop a plan for meeting NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs for low-Earth orbit and deep space operations in the 20-year period following enactment of this bill.  Such plan shall include:  the lifecycle cost estimates and a 5-year funding profile, the performance capabilities required to meet NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs, an identification of the projected space communications and navigation network and infrastructure needs, an identification of the projected Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System needs in the 20-year period following this bill's enactment, and the measures NASA is taking to mitigate threats to electromagnetic spectrum use.    (Sec. 305) Any contract between NASA and a provider (a person that provides domestic launch or domestic reentry services to the federal government) may provide that the United States will indemnify that provider against successful claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from launch services and reentry services carried out under the contract that are defined in it as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature, but only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to the activities under that contract:  is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, and  is not more than $1.5 billion (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such insurance or financial responsibility amount.   A contract made under this section that provides indemnification shall provide for:  notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the provider for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and  control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of such claim or suit and approval of any settlement.   A provider that has a contract with NASA under this section shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by:  a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under the contract; and  the federal government for damage or loss to government property resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under such contract.   NASA shall determine maximum probable losses within 90 days of the provider requesting such a determination and submitting all of the information that NASA requires. NASA may revise such a determination based on new information.  For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a provider shall not be required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than:  $500 million with respect to a third party, or $100 million with respect to the federal government; or  the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost.   An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility regarding this section shall protect to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services the federal government, its personnel and related entities, related entities of the provider, and government astronauts. NASA may not indemnify a provider under this section until there is a cross-waiver between NASA and the provider. The bill states that NASA shall reciprocally waive claims with a provider under which each party agrees to be responsible and agrees to ensure that its related entities are responsible for damage or loss to its property, or for losses resulting from any injury or death sustained by its employees or agents. Such a waiver shall apply only to the extent that the claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility. Indemnification under this section may exclude claims that result from the willfull misconduct of the provider or its related entities.  No payment may be made under this section unless NASA or its designee certifies that the amount is just and reasonable. NASA may not provide indemnification under this section for an activity requiring a license or permit under provisions relating to commercial space launch activities.  TITLE IV--ADVANCING HUMAN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION Subtitle A--Human Space Flight and Exploration Goals and Objectives (Sec. 411) The bill states that the long-terms goals for the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be:  to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, and to do so where practical, with the involvement of international, academic, and industry partners ,  crewed missions and progress toward achieving the expansion of human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to enable the potential for subsequent human exploration and the extension of human presence throughout the solar system, and  to enable a capability to extend human presence, including potential human habitation on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st Century.  (Sec. 412) The key U.S. objectives for human expansion into space shall include achieving human exploration of Mars and beyond through the prioritization of those technologies and capabilities best suited for such a mission in accordance with the stepping stone approach to exploration specified in federal law.   (Sec. 413) NASA shall manage human space flight programs, including the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion multipurpose crew vehicle, to enable humans to explore Mars and other space destinations.  (Sec. 414) NASA: (1) may conduct missions to intermediate destinations in order to achieve the objective of human exploration of Mars, and (2) shall incorporate any such missions into the human exploration roadmap.   The bill declares that in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the long-term exploration and utilization activities of the United States, NASA shall take all necessary steps, including engaging international, academic, and industry partners, to ensure that activities in NASA's human exploration program balance how those activities might also help meet the requirements of future exploration and utilization activities leading to human habitation on the surface of Mars. Within budgetary considerations, once an exploration-related project enters its development phase, NASA shall seek to complete such project without any undue delays. Furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of successfully conducting a crewed mission to the surface of Mars, the President may invite U.S. partners in the ISS program and other nations, as appropriate, to participate in an international initiative under the leadership of the United States.  (Sec. 415) NASA shall implement an exploration research and technology development program for enabling human and robotic operations.

DIVISION F--FDA USER FEE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2022 FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 This division extends through FY2027 the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect user fees for drugs, medical devices, generic drugs, and biosimilar biological products. It also addresses other related issues, such as modifying the formulas for calculating such user fees and reauthorizing various programs. (The FDA collects user fees from various entities, including companies that produce drugs and medical devices. The total amounts generated by each user fee program are set out in statutes. Generally, the FDA negotiates these user fees with the relevant industry every five years.) TITLE I--FEES RELATING TO DRUGS Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 (Sec. 1002) This section modifies various definitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Specifically, it modifies the definition of human drug application to include applications for certain allergenic extract products licensed on or after October 1, 2022. For the purposes of assessing the prescription drug program fee, if a drug manufacturer makes a request for a particular prescription drug to be placed on the list for discontinued drugs, the FDA shall consider the drug discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later. This section also establishes a statutory definition for skin-test diagnostic product. Generally, such a product is administered to the skin to detect a local hypersensitivity reaction to aid the diagnosis of an allergy or infection with certain pathogens. (Sec. 1003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments. (The base revenue and various adjustments set the total amount of user fees that the FDA must collect through the particular user fee program each fiscal year.) For the purposes of setting drug user fees, the FDA must make various adjustments including (1) increasing the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjusting the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees for FY2021. This section also establishes that a human drug application for a skin-test diagnostic product shall not be subject to certain fees. Furthermore, this section establishes a rule for fees for an approved human prescription drug that was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the same fiscal year. Generally, the relevant manufacturers of such a drug must pay the annual prescription drug program fee for that fiscal year, if the manufacturer has had a human drug application or supplement pending before the FDA after September 1, 1992. This section also modifies exemptions to the prescription drug program fees for certain drugs. Specifically, this section exempts from such fees (1) certain large volume parenteral products, (2) drugs that are pharmaceutically equivalent to certain FDA-approved drugs, and (3) skin-test diagnostic products. (Sec. 1005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority. TITLE II--FEES RELATING TO DEVICES Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022 (Sec. 2002) This section amends the statutory definition of process for the review of device applications to include activities related to de novo classification requests. (Medical devices are assigned to one of three classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the device's safety and effectiveness.) (Sec. 2003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses medical device user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027. For the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds. (Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements. Under this section, a laboratory shall conduct tests to support such assessments. (Sec. 2006) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, a program that allows accredited persons to review reports and make recommendations to the FDA pertaining to the initial classification of medical devices. (Sec. 2007) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to medical devices, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority. TITLE III--FEES RELATING TO GENERIC DRUGS  Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 (Sec. 3002) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses generic drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program. The FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly. The FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly. (Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority. TITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022 (Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of biosimilar biological product application to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition. (Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year through the user fee program. For the purposes of setting such user fees, the FDA must (1) increase the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjust the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees in FY2021. The FDA must also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year if doing so is necessary to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's review of biosimilar biological product applications. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly. The section also makes other changes to the biosimilar user fees, including by (1) authorizing the FDA to administratively remove from the biosimilar biological product development program a person who has failed to pay the required fee for two consecutive years, and (2) eliminating the biosimilar biological product fee. Furthermore, for the purposes of assessing the biosimilar biological product program fee, if a biosimilar product manufacturer makes a request for a particular biosimilar product to be placed on a list for discontinued products, the FDA shall consider the product discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later. If an approved biosimilar product was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the fiscal year, the manufacturer of the product must pay the annual biosimilar biological product program fee for that fiscal year. (Sec. 4005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to biosimilar biological products, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority. TITLE V--REAUTHORIZATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS (Sec. 5001) This section reauthorizes a National Institutes of Health program to (1) develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, and (2) award funds to entities with expertise in conducting research regarding such needs. (Sec. 5002) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, the humanitarian device exemption program, which authorizes the FDA to, for the purposes of an application for approval to market a medical device, waive certain effectiveness requirements for an eligible device designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects no more than 8,000 individuals in the United States. Specifically, a request for such an exemption must be submitted on or before December 17, 2022. (Sec. 5003) This section reauthorizes a program that provides grants or contracts to nonprofit consortia for demonstration projects to promote pediatric device development. (Sec. 5004) This section reauthorizes a provision that allows an applicant for market approval for an eligible single-enantiomer drug to make an election that may qualify the drug for a five-year market exclusivity period. (Sec. 5005) This section reauthorizes the Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, through which the FDA may enter into collaborative agreements with eligible entities to develop projects designed to achieve certain goals, such as fostering medical product innovation and accelerating medical product development. (Sec. 5006) This section reauthorizes an FDA program that provides grants to defray the costs of developing drugs, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases or conditions. (Sec. 5007) This section extends through December 17, 2022, a provision requiring the FDA to accredit persons to inspect facilities that manufacture certain classes of medical devices. (Sec. 5008) This section reauthorizes a provision requiring the FDA to post on its website quarterly reports with information on received generic drug applications and priority review applications. DIVISION G--HERMIT'S PEAK/CALF CANYON FIRE ASSISTANCE ACT Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act This division provides for monetary compensation to the persons injured by the prescribed fire burn in the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico that became a wildfire known as the Hermit's Peak Fire or the Hermit's Peak Fire/Calf Canyon Fire. Each person injured as a result the Hermit's Peak Fire shall be eligible to receive monetary compensation from the United States, including for personal injury, loss of property, business loss, or financial loss. An Office of Hermit's Peak Fire Claims is established within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to receive, process, and pay claims from persons injured by the fire. FEMA or the independent claims manager (which FEMA may appoint) shall, on behalf of the United States, investigate, consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, grant, deny, or settle any claim for money damages asserted by a person injured by the Hermit's Peak Fire. Any claimant aggrieved by a final decision of FEMA concerning compensation may, not later than 60 days after the date on which the decision is issued, bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico to modify or set aside the decision.","Economics and Public Finance",2022-09-30,1,0

It also provides additional funding for the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the Office of Tax Policy, the Tax Court, and Treasury departmental offices. Subtitle B--Prescription Drug Pricing Reform  Part 1--Lowering Prices Through Drug Price Negotiation (Sec. 11001) The act requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Specifically, the CMS must negotiate maximum prices for brand-name drugs that do not have other generic equivalents and that account for the greatest Medicare spending. The CMS must negotiate the prices of 10 drugs that are covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2026, 15 drugs that are covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2027, 15 drugs that are covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit or under Medicare medical services in 2028, and 20 drugs that are covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit or under Medicare medical services in 2029 and each year thereafter.  The selected drugs must be among the 50 drugs with the highest total spending over the most recent 12-month period under the Medicare prescription drug benefit or Medicare medical services and must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics). The act excludes (1) orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition, (2) plasma-derived products, and (3) drugs that account for less than $200 million in annual Medicare spending (adjusted annually for inflation). The CMS must enter into agreements with drug manufacturers to negotiate prices; manufacturers must submit information relating to costs and other data as part of the negotiation process. Manufacturers that fail to comply with negotiation requirements are subject to civil penalties. (Sec. 11002) The CMS may delay negotiations for certain biologics with pending biosimilars for up to two years upon manufacturer request. (Sec. 11003) Drug manufacturers are subject to excise taxes for failing to comply with negotiation requirements, such as failing to furnish required information during the negotiation process. (Sec. 11004) The act provides funds for FY2022 for the CMS to implement this program.  Part 2--Prescription Drug Inflation Rebates (Sec. 11101) In addition, the act requires drug manufacturers to issue rebates to the CMS for brand-name drugs without generic equivalents under Medicare medical services that cost $100 or more per year per individual and for which prices increase faster than inflation. Manufacturers that fail to comply are subject to civil penalties. The act provides funds through FY2031 for the CMS to implement this rebate program. (Sec. 11102) The act similarly requires drug manufacturers to issue rebates to the CMS for brand-name drugs without generic equivalents under the Medicare prescription drug benefit that cost $100 or more per year per individual and for which prices increase faster than inflation. Manufacturers that fail to comply are subject to civil penalties. The act provides funds through FY2031 for the CMS to implement this rebate program. Part 3--Part D Improvements and Maximum Out-of-Pocket Cap for Medicare Beneficiaries (Sec. 11201) The act eliminates beneficiary cost-sharing above the annual out-of-pocket spending threshold under the Medicare prescription drug benefit beginning in 2024 and caps annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000 in 2025 (with annual adjustments thereafter). It also establishes a program under which drug manufacturers provide discounts to beneficiaries who have incurred costs above the annual deductible beginning in 2025. The act also limits base premiums under the Medicare prescription drug benefit for 2024 through 2030 to a 6% annual increase or the amount that would otherwise apply under the prior methodology, whichever is less. The act provides funds through FY2031 for the CMS to implement these changes and requirements. (Sec. 11202) The act also establishes a process through which beneficiaries, including those eligible for low-income subsidies, may have their monthly out-of-pocket costs capped and paid in monthly installments beginning in 2025; it provides funds for FY2023 for the CMS to implement this process. Part 4--Continued Delay of Implementation of Prescription Drug Rebate Rule (Sec. 11301) The act further delays until 2032 implementation of a Department of Health and Human Services rule relating to the treatment of certain Medicare prescription drug benefit rebates from drug manufacturers for purposes of federal anti-kickback laws. Part 5--Miscellaneous The act establishes a series of additional programs and requirements relating to coverage under the Medicare prescription drug benefit and other programs. (Sec. 11401) The act eliminates cost-sharing under the Medicare prescription drug benefit for adult vaccines that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  (Sec. 11402) Beginning July 1, 2024, the act limits payment under Medicare medical services for biosimilars that do not have an initial average sales price to the payment amount for the reference biologic or the amount that would otherwise apply under the prior methodology, whichever is less. (Sec. 11403) The act also temporarily increases payment for other biosimilars under Medicare medical services. (Sec. 11404) Beginning in 2024, the act expands eligibility under the low-income subsidy program of the Medicare prescription drug benefit to allow those with income of up to 150% of the federal poverty line to receive full premium subsidies and a $0 deductible. (Sec. 11405) It also requires coverage, without cost-sharing, of adult vaccines that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). (Sec. 11406) In addition, the act caps cost-sharing under the Medicare prescription drug benefit for a month's supply of covered insulin products at (1) for 2023 through 2025, $35; and (2) beginning in 2026, $35, 25% of the government's negotiated price, or 25% of the plan's negotiated price, whichever is less. The act provides funds for FY2022 for the CMS to implement these provisions. (Sec. 11407) The act also waives the deductible for insulin furnished through covered durable medical equipment under Medicare medical services and limits coinsurance to $35 for a month's supply of such insulin beginning July 1, 2023. (Sec. 11408) The act provides that a health insurance plan may still be considered a high deductible health plan even if it does not have a deductible for insulin products.

TITLE I--ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTORS AND USER FEES (Sec.	101)	The bill amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to remove amounts appropriated for the development of regulations for advanced nuclear reactor technologies from the amount the NRC must recover through fees. (Sec.	102)	Effective FY2021, the bill:   excludes additional amounts from the amount the NRC must recover through fees, including amounts for research and development at universities; directs the NRC to collect fees equal to its budget authority, less excluded amounts; limits NRC's spending on corporate support costs; and places a cap on the amount of the annual fee that may be charged to an operating reactor,	which the NRC may waive if the cap compromises the NRC's safety and security mission.    Performance metrics and milestone schedules must be developed for activities requested by applicants and licensees.	In addition, the NRC must implement processes to ensure accurate invoicing. (Sec.	103) For commercial advanced nuclear reactors, the NRC must (1) establish stages within the licensing process; (2) increase the use of risk-informed, performance-based licensing evaluation techniques and guidance; and (3) establish by the end of 2027 a technology-inclusive regulatory framework that encourages greater technological innovation. The NRC must develop research and test reactor licensing. The NRC is also directed to train staff and develop the expertise required to implement the new licensing processes. The NRC must report to Congress on (1) the implementation of stages in the advanced reactor licensing process, and (2) the use of risk-informed and performance-based techniques within the existing regulatory framework. (Sec.	104)	The NRC must publish any necessary revisions to the guidance on the examination schedule for baffle-former bolts in certain reactors. (Sec.	105)	The NRC must submit to Congress a report describing the actions it has taken, or plans to take, to consider lessons learned from recent disasters regarding directed or spontaneous evacuations in densely populated urban and suburban areas. (Sec.	106)	The bill increases the percentage of operating costs that research reactors are allowed to recover from 50% to 75%, with up to 50% coming from energy sales. (Sec.	107)	The NRC must submit to Congress a report describing the status of the licensing process for accident tolerant fuel. (Accident tolerant fuel is a new technology that makes an existing commercial nuclear reactor more resistant to a nuclear incident and lowers the cost of electricity over the licensed lifetime of a reactor.) (Sec.	108)	The NRC must submit to Congress a report on the best practices for establishing and operating local community advisory boards. (Sec.	109)	The NRC must submit to Congress a report on actions it is taking to address the appearance of workplace reprisals. TITLE II--URANIUM (Sec.	201)	The NRC must (1) report to Congress on the duration of uranium recovery licenses and recommendations to improve the efficiency and transparency of uranium recovery licensing, and (2) complete a voluntary pilot program to determine the feasibility of establishing a flat fee structure for routine licensing matters relating to uranium recovery.","Energy",2019-01-14,0.444444444444444,0.555555555555556

Specifically, it requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), in disseminating information on juvenile delinquency prevention programs, to promote evidence-based programs and practices. It also adds, as a new purpose area, support for a continuum of evidence-based or promising programs that are trauma-informed, reflect the science of adolescent development, and are designed to meet the needs of at-risk youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system. TITLE II--CHARLES GRASSLEY JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAM (Sec. 201) The bill requires the OJJDP, in developing objectives, priorities, strategies, and long-term plans, to take into account scientific knowledge regarding: (1) adolescent development and behavior, and (2) the effects of delinquency prevention programs and juvenile justice interventions on adolescents. The OJJDP, in consultation with Indian tribes with a criminal justice function, must develop a policy to implement the provisions of this bill relating to Indian tribes. (Sec. 202) It expands membership on the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (Coordinating Council) to include the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the Secretary of the Interior. (Sec. 203) This section modifies requirements for the OJJDP annual report on juveniles in custody. Specifically, it adds ethnicity to the list of offender characteristics and expands the categories of information that must be summarized and analyzed. It adds requirements for the annual report to describe criteria used to determine what programs qualify as evidence-based and promising programs and funding provided to Indian tribes; and to analyze and evaluate the OJJDP internal controls and the total amount of payments recouped from grantees that violate the OJJDP policies and procedures. (Sec. 204) It increases from 2% to 5% the maximum amount of Formula Grant funds that may be used to provide technical assistance to states in complying with the core requirements and implementing a juvenile justice and delinquency plan. It increases each state's minimum allocation under the population-based Formula Grant program from $325,000 to $400,000 if the title II appropriation is less than $75 million in a fiscal year. A state's relative population of individuals under 18 years of age must be based on the most recent Census Bureau data. The 10% maximum amount of a state's Formula Grant allocation that can be used for planning and administration includes designation of at least one individual to coordinate and certify compliance with the core requirements.  (Sec. 205) This section modifies the required components of a state's juvenile justice and delinquency plan. A state's annual update to the three-year plan must describe how the plan is supported by or takes account of scientific knowledge regarding adolescent development and behavior and regarding the effects of prevention programs and juvenile justice interventions. A state must post its plan or amended plan on a publicly accessible website. The bill modifies State Advisory Group membership qualifications to include representatives of public agencies that prevent or treat mental health, substance abuse, or disabilities in adolescents; and individuals who represent victim or witness advocacy groups. It also increases from 24 years to 28 years the maximum age of youth members at the time of appointment. It eliminates the requirement for an eligible Indian tribe to perform law enforcement functions. A state's juvenile justice and delinquency plan must contain additional components, including plans to: provide alternatives to detention, reduce children in secure detention and corrections facilities, engage family members, use community-based services, promote evidence-based and trauma-informed programs and practices, and limit the use of restraints on pregnant juvenile offenders. The bill modifies program areas under the Formula Grant program. It revises existing program areas to specify that: (1) alternatives to detention programs include programs for active or former gang members; (2) educational programs and support services include projects to prevent and reduce truancy; and (3) the scope of juveniles served by mentoring, counseling, and training programs includes juveniles whose parent or guardian is incarcerated in a tribal facility. It adds new program areas to expand access to legal counsel, to inform juveniles of the opportunity and process for expunging juvenile records, to address the needs of at-risk girls, and to monitor compliance and provide technical assistance with the core requirements. The bill prioritizes funding for entities that meet the criteria for evidence-based or promising programs. The bill modifies the core requirements with which a state must comply to receive a full allocation of funds under the Formula Grant program. First, it revises the deinstitutionalization of status offenders core requirement, which prohibits the secure detention or confinement of a juvenile who commits a status offense (i.e., an offense that would not be a crime if committed by an adult). Specifically, use of the valid court order exception to securely detain or confine a juvenile status offender must comply with additional requirements, such as issuance of a court order and a seven-day maximum length of detention.  Second, it modifies the separation and jail removal core requirements to specify that sight or sound contact is the level of contact prohibited between juveniles and adults. Sight or sound contact means any physical, clear visual, or verbal contact that is not brief or inadvertent. Third, it revises the disproportionate minority contact requirement to require a state to implement policy, practice, and system improvement strategies to identify and reduce racial and ethnic disparities among youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system. It retains the prohibition against using numerical standards or quotas. A state must provide for an effective (previously, adequate) system of monitoring compliance with the core requirements. The OJJDP must annually conduct, and publish the results of, a compliance determination for each state that participates in the Formula Grant program. (Sec. 206) The bill repeals the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program. (Sec. 207) This section requires (currently, authorizes) the OJJDP to annually publish a plan to identify (currently, plan and identify) the purposes and goals of funded initiatives to research and evaluate juvenile justice matters. It revises and expands the list of juvenile justice matters initiatives. The OJJDP must study the coordination of services and treatment between the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. It must describe best practices in discharge planning and assess post-confinement living arrangements of juveniles who cannot return home. This bill directs (currently, authorizes) the OJJDP to analyze juvenile justice statistics. The OJJDP must, with respect to juvenile recidivism data, establish a uniform collection method, establish a common measurement system, and publish cumulative data collected by states.  (Sec. 208) It requires (currently, permits) the OJJDP to provide training, technical assistance, and information dissemination.  It adds requirements for the OJJDP to provide: training to states to implement the JJDPA core requirements, current protocols and best practices for achieving monitoring compliance, and information sharing regarding evidence-based and promising programs or practices.  It adds requirements for the OJJDP to provide technical assistance to state and local governments to comply with amendments to the core requirements and state plans; and to improve recruitment, selection, training, and retention of juvenile justice professionals.  The OJJDP must disseminate best practices for the treatment of status offenders. Finally, the OJJDP must disseminate best practices regarding legal representation of children; coordinate training and technical assistance programs for local and state juvenile detention and corrections personnel; provide training and technical assistance to relevant decision makers with respect to appropriate services and placement for youth with mental health or substance abuse needs; and provide training and technical assistance to enhance the capacity of courts, judges, and judicial personnel.  (Sec. 209) The OJJDP must, in developing guidance and procedures, consult state and local governments. It must ensure that requests for reports, compliance reports, state plan requirements, and other documentation respect confidentiality, encourage efficiency, and reduce duplication of reporting efforts. TITLE III--INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR LOCAL DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS  (Sec. 301) The bill revises the short title of title V of the JJDPA.  (Sec. 302) It adds definitions for the following terms: at-risk, eligible entity, delinquency prevention program, local policy board, mentoring, and state entity.  (Sec. 303) It eliminates the explicit requirement for the OJJDP to issue rules to carry out title V of the JJDPA. (Sec. 304) This section revises the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs:  to state that the purpose is to enable local communities to address unmet needs of at-risk or delinquent youth, including through a continuum of delinquency prevention programs; to direct the OJJDP to award grants to state entities for subgrants to eligible entities; and to limit the maximum set-aside for training and technical assistance.  (Sec. 305) The bill creates a new section and moves, to that section, the statutory authority for grants for tribal delinquency prevention and response programs. Of the amount available for programs under title V of the JJDPA, 11% is reserved for tribal delinquency prevention and response program grants.  (Sec. 306) The Government Accountability Office must evaluate the outcomes and results of delinquency prevention programs implemented by subgrantees. TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  (Sec. 401) The Government Accountability Office must evaluate OJJDP performance and audit selected grant recipients.  (Sec. 402) This section amends the JJDPA to add a new title:  that expresses the sense of Congress that the OJJDP must restore meaningful enforcement of, and states must ensure full compliance with, the core requirements; that subjects juvenile justice grants to accountability provisions; and that requires DOJ to identify and report on duplicative grant awards.  The bill reauthorizes through FY2023 programs and activities: (1) under title II of the JJDPA, including the State Formula Grants program and the Challenge Grants program; and (2) under title V of the JJDPA, including the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Program.  Additionally, it reauthorizes through FY2020 programs and activities: (1) for missing and exploited children, under title IV of the JJDPA; and (2) for runaway and homeless youth, under title III of the JJDPA.","Crime and Law Enforcement",2018-12-21,1,0

TITLE I--REFORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES Subtitle A--Reform of Procedures for Initiation, Preliminary Review, and Resolution of Claims (Sec. 101) The bill revises administrative and judicial dispute resolution procedures for certain claims by employees alleging that employing offices have violated their CAA rights and protections, including protections against sexual harassment. The bill eliminates the requirement that an employee participate in counseling and mediation before filing a claim with the OCWR alleging a violation. A hearing officer, appointed by the OCWR, must conduct a preliminary review of the claim to assess if the claimant is a covered employee and has stated a claim for which relief may be granted. Claimants who do not meet those criteria must be notified by the hearing officer that they may file a civil action in a U.S. district court within 90 days. Claimants who do meet the criteria may file a civil action in a U.S. district court within 70 days if they have not requested a hearing. This action terminates the preliminary review and prohibits subsequent preliminary reviews regarding the claim.  After the OCWR receives a claim from an employee of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) or of the Capitol Police alleging a CAA violation, the OCWR may recommend that the employee use AOC or Capitol Police grievance procedures for a specific period of time. Library of Congress (LOC) employees may elect to switch the applicable procedures for their claims between an agency's procedures and the procedures under this bill before specified steps in the procedures. (Sec. 102) If the claim alleges that a Member of Congress committed a CAA discrimination or retaliation violation, the OCWR must notify the Member of: (1) the possibility that the Member may be required to reimburse the Treasury for awards or settlements in connection with the claim; and (2) the right to intervene in related mediations, hearings, or civil actions.The OCWR must establish a secure electronic reporting and tracking system for initiating claim proceedings and keeping track of subsequent actions and proceedings. An employee must file a claim within 180 days after the alleged violation. (Sec. 103) Within 30 days after a claim is filed, the hearing officer's preliminary review of the claim must be reported to the employee and the employing office. The officer may use an additional period of not to exceed 30 days to conclude the review. Any preliminary reviews concerning allegations of discrimination or retaliation by a Member of Congress must be reported to congressional ethics committees. The OCWR may not appoint a hearing officer to conduct a hearing with respect to a claim if the officer conducted the preliminary review. (Sec. 104) The bill makes mediation between an employee filing a claim and the employing office optional. Failure of either party to request or accept mediation shall have no effect on the treatment of the claim, including a preliminary review, a formal hearing, or a civil action brought in a U.S. district court. The mediation period shall be 30 days, beginning on the first day after the second party agrees to the request for mediation. At the joint request of the parties, the mediation may be extended for one additional 30-day period. Subtitle B--Other Reforms (Sec. 111) Current and former Members of Congress must reimburse the Treasury if an employee receives an award or settlement for the Member's alleged act of discrimination or retaliation. Such funds may be withheld from the Member's salary or retirement account if the Member does not meet specified payment deadlines. For an award made pursuant to the decision of a hearing officer or a court in a civil case, this reimbursement requirement shall only apply if the hearing officer or court makes a separate finding that the Member's alleged act of discrimination or retaliation occurred. (Sec. 112) Congressional ethics committees must receive the final disposition of claims alleging CAA violations by Members of Congress or the senior staff of employing offices. The Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate must:   review any settlement agreement for a claim that includes an allegation of a CAA violation committed personally by a Senator, determine whether or not an investigation of the claim is warranted; and if the committee determines there was a violation, notify the OCWR to request reimbursement of the Treasury and to include the settlement in OCWR's annual report.  (Sec. 113) Upon an employee's request, the employing office may permit the employee to work remotely or grant the employee a paid leave of absence while a claim is pending. The employing office may also make another workplace adjustment or permit a remote work assignment that reduces interactions between the employee and any person alleged to have committed the CAA violation. In granting such paid leave of absence, the employing office may not require the employee to substitute his or her accrued paid vacation or personal leave. These provisions do not override a collective bargaining agreement. (Sec. 114) All information discussed or disclosed in mediation must be confidential. (Sec. 115) Noncongressional legislative offices that violate CAA requirements must reimburse the Treasury for resulting award or settlement payments. TITLE II--IMPROVING OPERATIONS OF OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE RIGHTS  (Sec. 201) OCWR reporting requirements are modified for claims, awards, and settlements. The OCWR must publish specified information about claims, awards, and settlements on its public website. The Committee on House Administration and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate shall issue rules establishing requirements for such reports. (Sec. 202) Within one year and biennially thereafter, the OCWR must survey employing offices regarding the workplace environment in such offices, including attitudes on sexual harassment. Employee responses must be voluntary. (Sec. 203) The OCWR shall establish a program for the permanent retention of its records, including those of CAA preliminary reviews, mediations, hearings, and other procedures. (Sec. 204) The OCWR must designate one or more of its employees to serve as a confidential advisor to current or former covered employees about their rights, potential claims based on their allegations, the OCWR's authority, and the process for filing a claim with the OCWR or the congressional ethics committees. (Sec. 205) The Government Accountability Office shall: (1) study, and make recommendations to improve, OCWR management practices; and (2) audit, and make recommendations to improve, OCWR cybersecurity systems and practices. TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS REFORMS (Sec. 301) This bill applies provisions of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 to CAA-covered employees. Such provisions prohibit employers from making employment decisions based on genetic information, including diseases or disorders of family members. (Sec. 302) CAA nondiscrimination requirements and remedies are extended to uncompensated legislative branch interns, detailees, fellows, and certain former unpaid staff members. (Sec. 303) The bill allows certain LOC visitors alleging discrimination in public services and accommodations by the LOC to elect to pursue a claim under the CAA or under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. (Sec. 304) Employing offices must post in a conspicuous place in their offices an OCWR notice that specifies employee CAA rights and OCWR's contact information.  (Sec. 305) The bill specifies that the CAA applies to the China Review Commission, the Congressional-Executive China Commission, the Helsinki Commission, the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training and Development, and their employees. (Sec. 306) Noncongressional CAA employing offices must develop programs to train and educate employees about their CAA rights and protections. (Sec. 307) The bill provides OCWR and CAA resources and services to employees outside of the area of the District of Columbia.
