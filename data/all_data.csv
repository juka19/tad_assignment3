Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act</b></p> <p>This bill updates copyright law by creating a new compulsory licensing system for digital music services that transmit sound recordings. It also provides for federal protection to sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which are currently only covered by state law. It also authorizes royalties for producers, mixers, and sound engineers that made a creative contribution to a sound recording.</p> <p>TITLE I--Music Licensing Modernization</p> <p><i>Musical Works Modernization Act</i></p> <p>Compulsory licensing systems allow a person or company to use a copyright-protected work by agreeing to pay a set rate, without having to negotiate with or get explicit permission from the rights holder.</p> <p>This title updates requirements for compulsory licenses for sound recordings. It establishes a new compulsory licensing system that is explicitly available to digital music service providers, where it was unclear whether previously available compulsory licenses granted the rights needed by such services.</p> <p>Under this title, compulsory licenses are available for sound recordings that have previously been distributed to the public. If the recording has not been publicly distributed, a digital music service can get a license for the recording with the permission of the owner of the distribution right.</p> <p>The new compulsory license is called a blanket license, which covers essentially all publicly distributed sound recordings. It gives the licensee the right to make and distribute digital copies of the recordings, along with reasonable and necessary activities such as making server and incidental reproductions. The blanket license shall be available January 1, 2021. </p> <p>When the blanket license becomes available, it shall replace any compulsory licenses that the digital music service provider had previously obtained. </p> <p>If a digital music provider and rights holder has a voluntary agreement in place, in most instances that voluntary agreement shall remain in effect even after the blanket license becomes available. </p> <p>The Copyright Office shall designate a nonprofit entity to administer the blanket license, which the bill refers to as the mechanical licensing collective.</p> <p>The collective's duties include:</p> <ul> <li>offering and administering blanket licenses, and collecting and distributing royalties;</li> <li>maintaining a musical works database with information needed to run the system;</li> <li>handling requests to claim ownership of copyrights, and devising a method for distributing royalties for works with unknown owners;</li> <li>collecting administrative assessments from digital music providers and other licensees to support the collective's functions;</li> <li>enforcing rights and obligations under the license; and</li> <li>maintaining and providing necessary information for proceedings to set royalty rates and assessments.</li> </ul> <p>Digital music service providers seeking a blanket license shall notify the mechanical licensing collective of its activities that fall under the license. The license shall go into effect within 30 days of the collective receiving the notice, unless the collective issues a written rejection explaining its reasons. The collective can only reject a notice of license if the provider has had a blanket license terminated in the past three years, or if the notice fails to meet statutory or legal requirements.</p> <p>If a digital music provider makes and distributes recordings without a license, it shall be barred from getting a blanket license for three years.</p> <p>The mechanical licensing collective shall establish a publicly-searchable database with information including the title of the recording, the copyright owners and ownership percentages of each, and the owners' contact information. The database shall also have entries for recordings where the ownership information is unknown or incomplete.</p> <p>Copyright owners shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide information about their recordings for the database.</p> <p>The mechanical licensing collective shall collect and distribute royalties based on usage reports provided by the digital service providers. For recordings with unknown copyright holders, the collective shall place the collected royalties in an interest-bearing account. After three years, the unknown owner royalties and accrued interest shall be distributed to the known copyright holders in the database, with each receiving a portion based on their relative market shares. The copyright holders shall pay no less than 50% of the unclaimed royalties to songwriters.</p> <p>The licensees shall make monthly royalty payments to the collective and submit reports about its usage of musical works covered by the blanket license. </p> <p>A digital music service provider shall be in default if it misses a monthly royalty payment or report, fails to pay an administrative assessment, or breaches another material term of the blanket license. The mechanical licensing collective shall notify the provider in writing of the default, and that the license shall automatically terminate in 60 days unless the service provider fixes the defects. </p> <p>The bill requires licensees with significant non-blanket activities to report their monthly usage data to the mechanical licensing collective and pay an administrative assessment to help support the collective's activities. These significant non-blanket licensees are typically large licensees that took voluntary licenses with rights holders rather than, or alongside, a blanket license.</p> <p>The Copyright Office shall also designate a nonprofit entity to coordinate the licensees' activities with the music collective. This digital licensee coordinator's duties include helping the mechanical licensing collective collect administrative assessments, and gathering and maintaining information for use in proceedings to set the blanket license royalty rates.</p> <p>The Copyright Royalty Board shall hold proceedings to set the administrative assessment rates, based on the mechanical licensing collective's costs.</p> <p>The board shall also hold proceedings to set the rates and terms for the blanket license that most clearly represent what would have been negotiated in the marketplace, and based on economic and competitive information presented by the parties. The mechanical licensing collective and digital licensee coordinator shall not participate directly in the rate setting proceeding, but may gather and provide economic and usage data for the parties.</p> <p>Compulsory licenses used for reproduction and distribution rights shall in most instances be automatically substituted for the blanket license when it becomes available. Compulsory licenses for making and distributing permanent downloads will not convert to the blanket license until the record company terminates the license.</p> <p>Voluntary licensing agreements shall remain in effect after the blanket license becomes available.</p> <p>This title also temporarily limits the liability of digital music service providers for unlicensed uses on or after January 1, 2018. For unlicensed uses that fall within the blanket license, copyright holders shall only recover the royalty they would have received. To take advantage of this limited liability, the service provider must make monthly attempts to identify the rights holders of the relevant recordings and pay royalties to them. For unidentified rights holders, the music provider must calculate and collect the royalties, to be paid to the mechanical licensing collective when the blanket license becomes available.</p> <p>TITLE II--Classics Protection and Access </p> <p><i>Classics Protection and Access Act</i></p> <p>This title provides federal protection for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which are currently only covered by state law.</p> <p>Sound recordings first published before 1923 shall be protected through 2021. Recordings from 1923 to 1946 shall be protected through the end of the year that is 100 years from the date of first publication. Recordings from 1947 to 1956 shall be protected through the end of the year that is 110 years from first publication. Recordings fixed after 1956 and before February 15, 1972, shall be protected until February 15, 2067.</p> <p>Owners of copyrights for pre-1972 recordings shall receive royalties for digital audio transmissions and reproductions. These royalties shall be paid in accordance with already-established statutory licensing schemes for post-1972 sound recordings.</p> <p>This title also allows for the noncommercial use of orphan works, which are sound recordings with unidentified rights owners. The noncommercial use shall be allowed after the user makes a reasonable attempt to find the rights owner and fails to do so, and a public notice period to give the owner a chance to object to the use.</p> <p>To qualify for statutory damages or attorneys' fees in an infringement action involving pre-1972 recordings, the rights owner must file with the Copyright Office a notice with information about its claimed works. </p> <p>This title also preempts most state law claims involving pre-1972 sound recordings. <br> <br> TITLE III--ALLOCATION FOR MUSIC PRODUCERS</p> <p><i>Allocation for Music Producers Act or the AMP Act</i> </p> <p>This title provides statutory authority for and expands existing practices for distributing royalties to producers, mixers, and sound engineers who made a creative contribution to a sound recording. A nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Board shall adopt procedures for such royalty payments for various digital transmissions of the recording.</p> <p>The procedures shall allow the owner of the exclusive right to publicly perform the sound recording or the featured artist to instruct the collective to calculate and distribute the payments to the producers, mixers, and sound engineers. The instruction is called a &quot;letter of direction.&quot;</p> <p>For sound recordings fixed before November 1, 1995, the nonprofit collective shall adopt policies for collecting and distributing such royalties, even without a letter of direction. The collective and those seeking royalties shall attempt to contact the featured artist to get a letter of direction. However, if the artist does not object within a specified time frame, the collective may distribute the royalties.</p> <p>This title preempts state laws that may otherwise apply, such as those related to abandoned property or escheatment.</p> <p>",Commerce,2018-10-11,0.28125,0.71875

""California wildfire disaster zone"" is the portion of the California wildfire disaster area determined by the President to warrant federal assistance under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California. </p> <p>A ""California wildfire disaster area"" is an area with respect to which between January 1, 2017, through January 18, 2018, a major disaster has been declared by the President under the Stafford Act by reason of wildfires in California. </p> <p>(Sec. 20102) This section waives the 10% additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans for up to $100,000 in

(This prohibits the budgetary effects of this subdivision from being counted for the purpose of PAYGO rules that prohibit certain revenue and direct spending legislation from increasing the deficit.) </p> <p>(Sec. 20402) In the Senate, this subdivision is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the FY2018 congressional budget resolution. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.) </p> <p>Subdivision 3--Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 </p> <p><em>Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 </em></p> <p>(Sec. 20101) This subdivision amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law). </p> <p>It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing continuing resolution (CR) expired because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted. </p> <p>The subdivision also: </p> <ul> <li>continues funding authority to maintain the schedule and deliver the required data according to statutory deadlines in the 2020 Decennial Census Program, </li> <li>makes additional funding available for the Southeastern Power Administration, </li> <li>permits the Department of Energy to draw down and sell up to $350 million of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during FY2018 and requires the proceeds to be used for the SPR modernization program, </li> <li>makes additional funding available to the judiciary for juror fees, </li> <li>provides additional funding for the staffing of newly opened or expanded Indian Health Service facilities, </li> <li>continues Department of Education authority to make account maintenance fee payments to guaranty agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan program, </li> <li>modifies existing authority to allow the Department of Education to waive cohort default rate requirements for public institutions of higher education operating in economically distressed counties, </li> <li>provides authority for new construction starts for projects associated with the DOD F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program, </li> <li>makes technical corrections related to the authority of the Department of Transportation to consolidate its credit programs, and </li> <li>extends HUD's HOPE VI program for the duration of the CR.

The title requires the sequester to take place in FY2018 and FY2019 as if the amendments that this title makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made. </p> <p>It also extends the sequester for mandatory spending through FY2027 (currently through FY2025) and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare. </p> <p>(Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.) </p> <p>(Sec. 30102) This section resets the balances on the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to zero. </p> <p>(Sec. 30103) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this bill. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve funds contained in the FY2018 budget resolution updated by one fiscal year. </p> <p>After April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution. </p> <p>This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 30104) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the House Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this bill. </p> <p>If a FY2019 congressional budget resolution has not been adopted by April 15, 2018, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2019 congressional budget resolution. </p> <p>The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect the budgetary effects of any legislation enacted during the 115th Congress that reduces the deficit or as otherwise necessary. </p> <p>This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 30105) This section specifies that section 30103 and section 30104 are enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of each chamber.

Under current law, surplus funds that exceed or would exceed the limit must be deposited into the Treasury. </p> <p>(Sec. 30206) The Department of Labor must award grants for states to conduct a program of reemployment services and eligibility assessments for certain individuals who receive unemployment compensation. </p> <p>This section also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require discretionary spending limits, committee allocations, and budget aggregates to be adjusted, subject to specified limits, for legislation that appropriates more than $117 million for a fiscal year for the grants. </p> <p>TITLE III--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT </p> <p>(Sec. 30301) The public debt limit is suspended through March 1, 2019.

Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction. </p> <p>The bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits.

The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation after 2018 using the chained CPI. </p> <p>(Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.) </p> <p>(Sec. 11022) This section modifies the child tax credit to temporarily: (1) increase the credit to $2,000 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and (2) allow a $500 nonrefundable credit for each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. </p> <p>The credit is phased out at AGI levels of $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $200,000 for individuals. </p> <p>The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,400 per qualifying child. In order to receive the credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. The requirement does not apply to a non-child dependent for whom the $500 non-refundable credit is claimed. </p> <p>(Sec. 11023) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitation for contributions of cash to public charities.</p> <p>(Sec. 11024) This section temporarily increases contribution limitations for ABLE accounts with respect to contributions made by the designated beneficiary of the account.

The limit does not apply to taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income. </p> <p>(Sec. 11043) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) temporarily limit the deduction for debt incurred on or before December 15, 2017, to mortgages of up to $750,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) suspend the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans. </p> <p>For taxable years beginning after 2025, the deduction applies to mortgages of up to $1 million regardless of when the indebtedness was incurred. </p> <p>(Sec. 11044) This section temporarily modifies the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. A taxpayer may only claim the deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster. The bill includes an exception for certain personal casualty losses that do not exceed personal casualty gains. </p> <p>(Sec. 11045) This section suspends all miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2% floor under present law. </p> <p>(Sec. 11046) This section suspends the overall limitation on itemized deductions, which currently applies when AGI exceeds a specified amount.</p> <p>(Sec. 11047) This section suspends the exclusion for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursements. </p> <p>(Sec. 11048) This section suspends the exclusion for qualified moving expense reimbursements, with an exception for members of the Armed Forces on active duty who move pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station.</p> <p>(Sec. 11049) This section suspends the deduction for moving expenses. </p> <p>(Sec. 11050) This section temporarily modifies a provision that limits the deduction for wagering losses to the extent of the gains from such transactions. The bill specifies that &quot;losses from wagering transactions&quot; include otherwise deductible expenses incurred in carrying out a wagering transaction (e.g., expenses for traveling to or from a casino). </p> <p>(Sec. 11051) This section repeals the deduction for alimony or separate maintenance payments from the payor spouse and the corresponding inclusion of the payments in the gross income of the recipient spouse. </p> <p>Part VI--Increase In Estate And Gift Tax Exemption </p> <p>(Sec. 11061) This section doubles the estate and gift tax exemption amount for decedents dying or gifts made after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, by increasing the basic exclusion amount from $5 million to $10 million.

The exemption amount is increased to $109,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return (half this amount for married taxpayers filing a separate return), and $70,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts).

It also modifies the alternative depreciation system (ADS) recovery period for such property. </p> <p>(Under current law, &quot;qualified improvement property&quot; is any improvement to an interior portion of a building which is nonresidential real property if such improvement is placed in service after the date such building was first placed in service. It does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to: the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, or the internal structural framework of the building.) </p> <p>A real property trade or business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest must use the ADS to depreciate nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property. </p> <p>(Sec. 13205) This section requires a farming business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest to use the ADS to depreciate any property with a recovery period of 10 years or more. </p> <p>(Sec. 13206) This section adjusts the amortization rules and schedules for certain research and experimentation expenditures. </p> <p>(Sec. 13207) This section allows expensing of certain costs of replanting lost or damaged citrus plants lost by reason of casualty. </p> <p>Subpart B--Accounting Methods </p> <p>(Sec. 13221) This section revises the rules associated with the timing of the recognition of income. </p> <p>Part IV--Business-Related Exclusions And Deductions </p> <p>(Sec. 13301) This section limits the deduction for business interest to the sum of: (1) business interest income for the year, (2) 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and (3) the floor plan financing interest of the taxpayer for the taxable year. </p> <p>The amount of any business interest not allowed as a deduction for any year may be carried forward indefinitely, with the exception of partnerships which are subject to additional carryforward rules specified in the bill. </p> <p>&quot;Business interest income&quot; is the amount of interest includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which is properly allocable to a trade or business. It does not include investment income. </p> <p>&quot;Floor plan financing interest&quot; is interest paid on debt used to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale or lease and secured by the inventory so acquired. </p> <p>The bill includes exceptions for: </p> <ul> <li> small businesses that meet the gross receipts test, </li> <li> the trade or business of performing services as an employee, </li> <li> any electing farming business, </li> <li> any electing real property trade or business, and </li> <li> certain regulated public utilities. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 13302) This section modifies the net operating loss deduction to: (1) limit the deduction to 80% of taxable income with an exception for property and casualty insurance companies, (2) repeal the two-year and other specified carryback provisions, (3) allow an indefinite carryforward of net operating losses, and (4) allow a two-year carryback for certain losses incurred in the trade or business of farming. </p> <p>(Sec. 13303) This section modifies the rule providing for the nonrecognition of gain in the case of like-kind exchanges to limit the application of the rule to real property that is not held primarily for sale. </p> <p>(Sec. 13304) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain expenses for entertainment and fringe benefits. </p> <p>The bill denies deductions for amounts paid or incurred for: </p> <ul> <li> an activity generally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation; </li> <li> membership dues for any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes; </li> <li> a facility or portion thereof used in connection with any of the above items; </li> <li> providing any qualified transportation fringe to employees of the taxpayer; or </li> <li> providing transportation for commuting between the employee's residence and place of employment, except as necessary for ensuring the safety of the employee. </li> </ul> <p>Under current law, taxpayers may deduct 50% of the food and beverage expenses associated with operating their trade or business, subject to certain exceptions. The bill temporarily expands the 50% limitation to include expenses of an employer associated with providing food and beverages through an eating facility that meets the requirements for a de minimis fringe. </p> <p>(Sec. 13305) This section repeals the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 13306) This section prohibits deductions for trade or business expenses for any amount paid or incurred (whether by suit, agreement, or otherwise) to, or at the direction of, a government or governmental entity in relation to the violation of any law or the investigation or inquiry by such government or entity into the potential violation of any law. </p> <p>The bill includes exceptions for amounts constituting restitution or paid to come into compliance with law, amounts paid or incurred as a result of certain court orders, and taxes due. </p> <p>The bill also establishes reporting requirements for government entities with respect to certain fines, penalties, and other amounts. </p> <p>(Sec. 13307) This section prohibits a tax deduction for trade or business expenses paid or incurred for: (1) any settlement or payment related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse if such settlement or payment is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, or (2) attorney's fees related to such a settlement or payment. </p> <p>(Sec. 13308) This section eliminates the deduction for lobbying expenditures to influence the legislation of any local council or similar governing body, including an Indian tribal government. </p> <p>(Sec. 13309) This section requires a three-year holding period (one year under current law) for certain net long-term capital gains with respect to partnership interests held in connection with the performance of investment services. If the holder of an applicable partnership interest is allocated gain from the sale of property held for less than three years, that gain is treated as short-term capital gain and is taxed as ordinary income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13310) This section prohibits cash, gift cards, and other non-tangible personal property from being considered tax deductible employee achievement awards. </p> <p>(Under current law, tangible personal property may be considered a deductible employee achievement award if other specified requirements are met.)</p> <p>The bill specifies that &quot;tangible personal property&quot; does not include: (1) cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements conferring only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited array of such items pre-selected or pre-approved by the employer); or (2) vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items. </p> <p>(Sec. 13311) This section eliminates the deduction for living expenses incurred by Members of Congress.

For the five-year period beginning in the year in which a qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service, the credit is equal to the ratable share for each year, which is 20% of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to the building, as allocated ratably to each year during the period. </p> <p>(Sec. 13403) This section allows employers to claim a general business credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to employees during any period in which such employees are on family and medical leave if the rate of payment under the program is 50% of the wages normally paid to an employee. </p> <p>The credit is increased by 0.25% (but not above 25%) for each percentage point by which the rate of payment exceeds 50%. The maximum amount of family and medical leave that may be taken into account with respect to any employee for any taxable year is 12 weeks. </p> <p>(Sec. 13404) This section repeals the authority to issue tax-credit bonds and direct-pay bonds. </p> <p>Part VI--Provisions Related To Specific Entities And Industries </p> <p>Subpart A--Partnership Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 13501) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of gains or losses of foreign persons from the sale or exchange of interests in partnerships engaged in trade or business within the United States. </p> <p>Under the bill, gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that the transferor would have had effectively connected gain or loss had the partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange. </p> <p>A partner's distributive share of gain or loss on the deemed sale must be determined in the same manner as the partner's distributive share of the non-separately stated taxable income or loss of the partnership. </p> <p>The bill also sets forth withholding requirements with respect to amounts realized from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest. </p> <p>(Sec. 13502) This section modifies the definition of &quot;substantial built-in loss&quot; with respect to the transfer of an interest in partnership. The bill specifies that &quot;a substantial built-in loss&quot; also exists if the transferee partner would be allocated a loss of more than $250,000 if the partnership assets were sold for cash equal to their fair market value immediately after such transfer. </p> <p>(Sec. 13503) This section modifies the basis limitation on a partner's distributive share of a partnership loss to require a partner's distributive share of partnership charitable contribution and taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and U.S. possessions to be taken into account in determining the limitation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13504) This section repeals the rule that provides for a technical termination of partnerships if, within any 12-month period, there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits. </p> <p>Subpart B--Insurance Reforms </p> <p>(Sec. 13511) This section repeals the operations loss deduction for life insurance companies and allows the net operating loss deduction under section 172 of the IRC. </p> <p>(Sec. 13512) This section repeals the small life insurance company deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 13513) This section revises the tax treatment of income or loss resulting from a change in the method of computing life insurance company reserves. The bill eliminates the 10-year period for taking into account the changes and requires the changes to be taken into account as adjustments attributable to a change in the method of accounting. </p> <p>(Sec. 13514) This section repeals the special rule for distributions to shareholders of a stock life insurance company from a pre-1984 policyholders surplus account, which provides that amounts in the account are not taxed unless the amounts are treated as distributed to shareholders or subtracted from the account. The bill requires a life insurance company with such an account to pay taxes on the balance of the account ratably over the first eight taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 13515) This section modifies the proration rules for property and casualty insurance companies to replace the 15% reduction with a reduction equal to 5.25% divided by the highest corporate tax rate in effect. (Under the top corporate rate of 21% that takes effect in 2018, the proration percentage is 25%.) </p> <p>(Under the proration rules, in calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property or casualty insurance company must reduce the amount of the losses incurred by a specified percentage of: (1) the insurer's tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received, and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts the company owns.) </p> <p>(Sec. 13516) This section repeals the special estimated tax payment rules for insurance companies. </p> <p>(Sec. 13517) This section modifies the rules for computing life insurance tax reserves that are used in determining the taxable income of a life insurance company. </p> <p>(Sec. 13518) This section modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing dividends received deductions and reserve deductions with respect to untaxed income. For purposes of the life insurance proration rule, the company's share is 70% and the policyholder's share is 30%. </p> <p>(Sec. 13519) This section modifies the requirements for the capitalization of policy acquisition expenses of insurance companies to extend the amortization period from 120 months to 180 months. </p> <p>Under current law, policy acquisition expenses are determined as that portion of the insurance company's general deductions for the taxable year that does not exceed a specified percentage of the net premiums for the year on each of three categories of insurance contracts. </p> <p>The bill increases these percentages from 1.75% to 2.09% for annuity contracts, from 2.05% to 2.45% for group life insurance contracts, and from 7.7% to 9.2% for all other specified insurance contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 13520) This section establishes reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts in a reportable policy sale. It also imposes reporting requirements on the payor in the case of the payment of reportable death benefits. </p> <p>A &quot;reportable policy sale&quot; is the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract. </p> <p>(Sec. 13521) This section sets forth requirements for the determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. The bill specifies that no basis adjustment shall be made for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges incurred under an annuity or life insurance contract. </p> <p>(Sec. 13522) This section exempts the transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, in a reportable policy sale from the transfer for valuable consideration rule. </p> <p>(Under current law, the transfer for valuable consideration rule provides that, if a life insurance contract or an interest in a contract is transferred for a valuable consideration, the tax exclusion for amounts received under a life insurance contract due to the death of the insured is limited to the sum of the actual value of the consideration and the premiums and other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee.) </p> <p>(Sec. 13523) This section modifies the reserve discounting rules applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to: (1) modify the interest rate used to discount unpaid losses, (2) modify the computational rules for loss payment pattern, and (3) repeal the election to use a taxpayer's historical loss payment pattern. </p> <p>Subpart C--Banks and Financial Instruments </p> <p>(Sec. 13531) This section limits the deduction for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums for certain financial institutions with consolidated assets that exceed $10 billion. </p> <p>(Sec. 13532) This section repeals the exclusion from gross income for interest on a bond issued to advance refund another bond. </p> <p>Subpart D--S Corporations </p> <p>(Sec. 13541) This section allows a nonresident alien individual to be a qualifying beneficiary of an electing small business trust (ESBT), which is a type of trust that is permitted to hold shares in an S corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13542) This section specifies that the charitable contribution deduction of an ESBT is determined by the rules applicable to individuals rather than the rules applicable to trusts, except that the deductions for costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust shall be treated as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13543) This section modifies the tax treatment of S corporation conversions to C corporations. </p> <p>Part VII--Employment </p> <p>Subpart A--Compensation </p> <p>(Sec. 13601) This section modifies a provision that limits the deduction for compensation of covered employees of a publicly held corporation to salaries of no more than $1 million per year. The bill: (1) repeals the performance-based compensation and commission exceptions, (2) modifies the definition of &quot;covered employee,&quot; and (3) expands the definition of &quot;publicly held corporation.&quot; </p> <p>The bill includes an exception for compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date. </p> <p>(Sec. 13602) This section imposes an excise tax on excess tax-exempt organization executive compensation. The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer. </p> <p>Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years. </p> <p>(Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation. </p> <p>Subpart B--Retirement Plans </p> <p>(Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA. </p> <p>(Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan. </p> <p>(Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.) </p> <p>The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017. </p> <p>In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A &quot;qualified plan loan offset amount&quot; is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant. </p> <p>Part VIII--Exempt Organizations </p> <p>(Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities. </p> <p>(Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility. </p> <p>(Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights. </p> <p>(Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization. </p> <p>Part IX--Other Provisions </p> <p>Subpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period. This section does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 13802) This section lowers the excise tax rate on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or imported by the importer. </p> <p>For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to the importer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13803) This section allows the transfer of beer between bonded facilities without payment of tax if specified requirements are met. </p> <p>(Sec. 13804) This section modifies the credit against the excise tax on wine for small domestic for 2018 and 2019 to: </p> <ul> <li> make the credit available to all wine producers and importers by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation; </li> <li>establish credit rates of: (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine; </li> <li> establish adjusted credit rates for hard cider; and </li> <li> make sparkling wine producers and importers eligible for the credit. </li> </ul> <p>The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon. </p> <p>(Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for &quot;mead&quot; and &quot;low alcohol by volume wine&quot; that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine. </p> <p>(Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter. </p> <p>Members of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates. </p> <p>(Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax.

The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes. </p> <p>Part I--Outbound Transactions </p> <p>Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations. </p> <p>A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). </p> <p>No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section. </p> <p>The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception. </p> <p>(Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation. </p> <p>For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation. </p> <p>The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes. </p> <p>The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings. </p> <p>The tax may be paid in installments over eight years. </p> <p>The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts. </p> <p>Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income </p> <p>Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill. </p> <p>Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments </p> <p>(Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply. </p> <p>Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion </p> <p>(Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of &quot;intangible property&quot; to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual. </p> <p>The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property. </p> <p>The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity. </p> <p>A &quot;disqualified related party amount&quot; is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid transaction&quot; is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid entity&quot; is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill </p> <p>(Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends. </p> <p>Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System </p> <p>(Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion. </p> <p>(Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries. </p> <p>(Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source. </p> <p>A &quot;Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss. </p> <p>Part II--Inbound Transactions </p> <p>(Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax. </p> <p>An &quot;applicable taxpayer&quot; is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers). </p> <p>Part III--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities. </p> <p>(Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income. </p> <p>TITLE II </p> <p>(Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain.</p> <p>Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons. </p> <p>Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program. </p> <p>(Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.</p> <p> (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury. </p> <p>DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage. </p>",Taxation,2017-12-22,0.0,1.0

(Medical devices are assigned to one of three classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the device's safety and effectiveness.)</p> <p>(Sec. 2003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses medical device user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027.</p> <p>For the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds.</p> <p>(Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements. Under this section, a laboratory shall conduct tests to support such assessments.</p> <p>(Sec. 2006) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, a program that allows accredited persons to review reports and make recommendations to the FDA pertaining to the initial classification of medical devices.</p> <p>(Sec. 2007) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to medical devices, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE III--FEES RELATING TO GENERIC DRUGS<br> <em><br> Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 3002) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses generic drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program.</p> <p>The FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly.</p> <p>The FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>(Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS</p> <p><em>Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of <em>biosimilar biological product application </em>to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition.</p> <p>(Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees.

The employing office may also make another workplace adjustment or permit a remote work assignment that reduces interactions between the employee and any person alleged to have committed the CAA violation. In granting such paid leave of absence, the employing office may not require the employee to substitute his or her accrued paid vacation or personal leave.
